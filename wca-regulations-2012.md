# WCA Regulations 2012

The WCA Regulations are supplemented by the WCA Guidelines.

To make the Regulations and Guidelines easier to read we use "he" where the reader should read "she or he".
The use of the words "must", "must not", "shall", "shall not", "should", "should not" and "may" comply with RFC 2119.


## Article 1: Officials

- 1a) A competition must include a WCA Delegate and an organisation team (consisting of one or more individuals) with the following officials: judges, scramblers and score takers.
- 1b) The organisation team of a competition is responsible for logistics before and during the competition.
- 1c) The WCA Delegate may delegate responsibilities to other members of the organisation team, but is ultimately accountable for how these responsibilities are carried out. The WCA Delegate for a competition is responsible for:
  - 1c1) Reporting to the WCA Board regarding adherence to WCA Regulations during the competition, the overall course of the competition, and any incidents. The report must be submitted to the WCA Board within one week of the competition date.
  - 1c3) Sending the competition results to the WCA Results Team.
    - 1c3a) All scramble sequences used during a competition must be sent with the results of the competition.[NOTE: Why? I know this would be difficult with Australian competitions. Usually Tim prints of lots of scramble sheets and I just pick one at random for any given event/round/heat (depending on the event). I try to keep track of which scramble sheet was used (by writing it on the sheet as I go), but this is mainly for my own reference so I know if a scramble sheet has been used. Following these regulations would require a lot of extra work for delegates, having to keep all scrambles handy on their computer and then sift through to find the appropriate ones. And for what need? I can’t see the scrambles being of any use to the WCA.]
    - 1c3b) Scramble sequences must be labelled with the events, rounds, and heats for which they were used.
  - 1c4) Sending corrections to the competition results to the WCA Board.
  - 1c5) Advising the other officials where necessary.
  - 1c6) Approving all events and round formats of a competition, before the competition starts, and if changes are required during the competition.
  - 1c7) Decisions about disqualifying competitors during the competition.
  - 1c8) Providing the scramble sequences.
  - 1c9) Decisions about changes to the scheduled times of rounds. In cases of such changes, a clear announcement must be made to all competitors.
  - 1c10) Making a copy of the WCA Regulations available at the competition.
- 1e) Each event must have one or more judges.
  - 1e1) A judge is responsible for executing the procedures of the event.
    - 1e1a) A judge may judge multiple competitors simultaneously at the discretion of the Delegate, as long as the judge is able ensure that all WCA Regulations are followed at all times.
  - 1e2) Each competitor shall be available for judging, if needed by organisation team. Penalty: disqualification from the competition.
- 1f) Each event must have one or more scramblers. Exception: puzzles that are not scrambled
  - 1f1) A scrambler applies scramble sequences to prepare solved puzzles for attempts.
  - 1f2) Each competitor shall be available for scrambling, if needed by organisation team. Penalty: disqualification from the competition.
- 1g) Each event must have one or more score takers.
  - 1g1) A score taker is responsible for compiling results.
  - 1g2) Any change to the result on a score sheet must be made the discretion of the WCA Delegate.
- 1h) Competitors in the same round of an event may be divided into heats.
  - 1h1) Scramblers for a round must not scramble for competitors in their own heat before they have finished all of their attempts for the round. Scramblers and judges must not see or judge any scrambles from their heat that they have not attempted yet.
  - 1h2) Competitors in the same heat must use the same scramble sequences. Different heats must use different scramble sequences.
- 1j) All officials may compete in the competition.
- 1k) Officials may serve multiple roles (e.g. organisation team, WCA Delegate, judge, score taker, scrambler).


## Article 2: Competitors

- 2a) Any person may compete in a WCA competition if he:
  - 2a1) Complies with WCA Regulations.
  - 2a2) Meets the competition requirements, which must be clearly announced before the competition.
  - 2a3) Is not suspended by WCA Board.
- 2b) Competitors below the age of 18 must obtain consent from their parent(s)/guardian(s) to register and compete.
- 2c) Competitors shall register by providing all information required by the organisation team (including: name, country, date of birth, gender, contact information, selected events). [NOTE: There was a thread on the WCA forums about gender; why do we need that information? I do not see any reason why gender should have to be provided if requested. Same applies to 2d.]
  - 2c1) A competitor shall not be eligible to compete without a completed registration, as determined by the organisation team.
- 2d) A competitor's name, country, gender, and competition results are considered public information. All other personal information is considered confidential, and must not be disclosed to outside organisations/persons without the consent of the competitor.
- 2e) Competitors must represent a country of which they hold citizenship. The WCA Delegate should verify citizenship standing by means of documents (e.g. a passport). If a competitor is found ineligible to represent the country under which they have registered, the competitor may be disqualified retroactively and/or suspended, at the discretion of the WCA Board.
  - 2e1) The eligible countries are defined by the Wikipedia article "List of sovereign states" ("UN member states and observer states" and "Other states").
  - 2e2) Competitors with updates to their citizenship status may change their country of representation in their first competition of a calendar year.
- 2f) Competitors must obey venue rules and conduct themselves in a considerate manner.
- 2g) Competitors must remain quiet when inside the designated competition area. Talking is permitted, but must be kept at a reasonable level, and away from competitors who are actively competing.
- 2h) Competitors shall be fully dressed while in the competition venue. At the discretion of the Delegate, competitors may be disqualified from the competition for inappropriate clothing.
- 2i) While competing, competitors must not use sound or other electronic equipment (e.g. cell phones, MP3 players, dictaphones, additional lighting).
- 2j) The WCA Delegate may disqualify a competitor from a specific event.
  - 2j1) If a competitor is disqualified from an event for any reason, he is not eligible for any more attempts in the event.
  - 2j2) If a competitor is disqualified during the course of an event, his earlier results shall remain valid. Exception: cheating or defrauding (see Regulation 2k2a).
- 2k) The WCA Delegate may disqualify a competitor from the competition (i.e. from all events of the competition) if the competitor:
  - 2k1) Fails to check in or register in time for the competition.
  - 2k2) Is suspected of cheating or defrauding the officials during the competition.
    - 2k2a) The WCA Delegate may disqualify any suspected results.
  - 2k3) Behaves in a way that is unlawful, violent or indecent; or intentionally damages venue facilities or personal property within the venue.
  - 2k4) Interferes with, or distracts others during, the competition.
  - 2k5) Fails to abide by WCA Regulations during the competition.
- 2l) A competitor may be disqualified immediately, or after a warning, depending on the nature and severity of the infraction.
- 2m) A disqualified competitor is not eligible for the refund of any expenses due to participating in the competition.
- 2n) Competitors may verbally dispute a ruling to the WCA Delegate.
- 2o) Disputes are only permitted during the competition, within 30 minutes after the disputed incident happened and before the beginning of the next round of the event. [NOTE: What if there isn’t a next round of the event? It should have something like “and before the beginning of the next round of the event, if applicable”. Otherwise, how long does the delegate have?]
- 2p) The WCA Delegate must resolve the dispute before the beginning of the next round of the event. [NOTE: See 2o.]
- 2r) The competitor must accept all final rulings of the WCA Delegate. Penalty: disqualification from the competition.
- 2s) Exceptions for documented disabilities:
  - 2s1) For competitors with hearing disabilities, judges may replace the vocal instructions with hand signals. [NOTE: Is it possible to have some sort of direction as to suitable hand signals? I understand that probably none of the WRC members are familiar with sign language, so this may be a big request to make. But if someone has some direction in which we could take this further it would be very helpful.]
  - 2s2) For competitors with physical disabilities, judges may assist with starting and stopping the timer.
  - 2s3) Competitors with other disabilities that may prevent them from abiding by one or more WCA Regulations may request special accommodations with the WCA Delegate.
- 2t) Each competitor must be familiar with and understand the WCA Regulations before the competition.


## Article 3: Puzzles

- 3a) Competitors must provide their own puzzles for the competition.
  - 3a1) Competitors must be present and ready to compete when they are called to compete for a round. Penalty: disqualification from the event.
- 3b) Puzzles must be fully operational, such that normal scrambling is possible.
- 3c) Polyhedral puzzles must use a colour scheme with one colour per face in the solved state. Each puzzle variation must have moves, states and solutions functionally identical to the original puzzle. [NOTE: I think it should be made explicit that puzzles cannot perform additional moves to the original puzzle, as this is not technically ruled out as long as the puzzle can still perform identical moves to the original.]
- 3d) Puzzles must have coloured stickers, coloured tiles, or painted/printed colours.
  - 3d1) Exception: Competitors with a medically documented visual disability may use textured puzzles with different textures on different faces. Textures/patterns must be uniform per face. Each face should have a distinct colours, to aid in scrambling and judging.
- 3e) The colours of puzzles must be solid, with one uniform colour per face. Each colour on the puzzle must be clearly distinct from the other colours.
- 3f) Stickers/tiles/textures/paint must not be thicker than 1.5 mm, or the generally available thickness for non-cube puzzles.
- 3g) Puzzles may be refined internally by sanding or lubricating.
- 3h) Modifications that enhance the basic concept of a puzzle are not permitted.
- 3i) "Pillowed" and other modified versions of puzzles are permitted only if the modification does not make any additional information available to the competitor (e.g. identity of pieces), as compared to an unmodified version of the same puzzle.
  - 3i1) Exception: Pillowed 7x7x7 cubes are permitted.
  - 3i2) "Stickerless" cubes, and other cubes whose face colours are visible inside the cube, are not permitted.
- 3j) Any modifications to a puzzle that result in poor performance by a competitor are not grounds for additional attempts.
- 3k) Puzzles must be clean, and must not have any markings, elevated pieces, damage, or other differences that distinguish any piece from a similar piece. [NOTE: It should be added that the decision on 3k should be made at the discretion of the delegate, otherwise 3k literally demands perfect stickering in all cases, which is a bit of a stretch.]
- 3l) Puzzles must be approved by the WCA Delegate before use in the competition.
- 3m) Cube puzzles must have at most one logo. For the Rubik's Cube or bigger cube puzzles the logo must be placed on one of the centre pieces.
  - 3m1) Colourless engravings (max. 1 per colour) are not considered logos.
- 3n) All brands of puzzles and puzzle parts are permitted, as long as the puzzles comply with all WCA Regulations.


## Article 4: Scrambling

- 4a) A scrambler applies scramble sequences to the puzzles.
- 4b) Puzzles must be scrambled using computer-generated random scramble sequences.
  - 4b1) Generated scrambles must not be inspected before the competition, and must not be filtered or selected in any way by the WCA Delegate.
  - 4b2) Scramble sequences for a round must be available only to the WCA Delegate and the scramblers for the event, until the end of the round. 
- 4d) Scrambling orientation:
  - 4d1) Cube puzzles and Megaminx shall be scrambled with the white face (if not possible, then the lightest face) on top and the green face (if not possible, then the darkest adjacent face) on the front.
  - 4d2) Pyraminx shall be scrambled with the yellow face (if not possible, then the lightest face) on bottom and the green face (if not possible, then the darkest adjacent face) on the front.
  - 4d3) Square-1 shall be scrambled with the darker colour on front (out of the 2 possible scrambling orientations).
- 4f) Competition scramble sequences must be generated using the current official version of the official WCA scramble program (available via the WCA website).


## Article 5: Puzzle Defects

- 5a) Examples of puzzle defects include: popped pieces, broken wires, pieces twisted in place, and detached screws/caps/stickers. [NOTE: Which puzzle uses wires? Magics use strings, if that is what was meant. At least that won’t matter soon, but otherwise I’m at a loss as to where the wires come from.]
- 5b) If a puzzle defect occurs during an attempt, the competitor may choose to repair the defect and continue the attempt, or to stop the attempt. [NOTE: Does the repair have to occur immediately? If so, what if the competitor is unaware of the defect? For example, a centre cap from a 7x7 falls off subtly into the competitors lap, and they don’t notice for a couple of minutes. It would be harsh to DNF them for not fixing immediately, and likewise it would be harsh to DNF a competitor that notices immediately but is in the middle of an algorithm at speed and doesn’t react quick enough to stop turning the puzzle. Regardless, whatever the intention of this regulation, it needs to be clarified whether the repair must happen immediately or not, and if not, when?]
  - 5b1) If a competitor chooses to repair the puzzle, he must repair only the defective pieces. Tools and/or pieces of other puzzles must not be used to repair the original puzzle. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
  - 5b2) Any repair to a puzzle must not give the competitor any advantage in solving the puzzle. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
  - 5b3) Permitted repairs:
    - 5b3a) If any pieces have fallen out or moved out of place, the competitor may place them back.
    - 5b3b) If, after repairing the puzzle but before the end of the attempt, the competitor finds that the puzzle is unsolvable, he may disassemble and reassemble a maximum of 4 pieces to make the puzzle solvable.
    - 5b3c) If the puzzle is unsolvable, and can be made solvable by rotating a single corner piece, the competitor may correct the corner piece by twisting it in place without disassembling the puzzle.
  - 5b4) During blindfolded events, a puzzle defect must be repaired during the attempt, and all repairs must be performed blindfolded. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
  - 5b5) If parts of the puzzle are still defective or not fully placed at the end of the attempt, the result shall be recorded as the worst state obtainable by reassembling the puzzle.
- 5c) If a competitor has a puzzle defect, this does not give him the right to an extra attempt.


## Article 7: Environment

- 7a) A competition may be held at any location, indoors or outdoors. [NOTE: Come to think of it, this regulation is extreme. What if I wanted to host it at the nearest rubbish dump? Sure, maybe no one would come, but the location in itself wouldn’t be means to disallow the competition. I know it would be a job and a half to come up with specific parameters, but the way 7a is right now is unacceptable.]
- 7b) Spectators must remain at least 1.5 metres away from the competition stage when it is in use.
- 7c) Lighting of the competition area must be given special attention. Lighting should be neutral, such that competitors can easily differentiate among the colours on the puzzles.
- 7e) The competition area must be smoke-free, and must have a reasonable noise-level. [NOTE: As much as I abhor smoking, and wish the entire world was rid of that stench, it is unfortunately often very difficult to achieve a completely smokefree area. Certainly we should be allowed to prohibit smoking at venues, but outdoor venues and rooms close to the outside where people could be smoking are going to be at risk of breaching this regulation. As for noise-level, I think that should be scrapped entirely. Public venues (such as shopping malls, like we have done here for 2010 and 2011 Australian Nationals) are always going to be noisy. If this point stays, “must” must be changed to “should preferably” ;)]
- 7f) Solving station:
  - 7f1) Definitions:
    - 7f1a) Stackmat: The Speedstacks Stackmat timer and a full-size compatible mat.
    - 7f1b) Mat: The mat of the Stackmat.
    - 7f1c) Timer: The timer of the Stackmat.
    - 7f1d) Surface: The flat surface on which the Stackmat has been placed. The mat is considered a part of the surface. The timer is not considered a part of the surface.
  - 7f2) The timer must be attached to the mat and placed directly on the table, desk or other suitable console, with the timer on the side of the mat nearest to the competitor. The mat must be placed flush against the surface of the table. [NOTE: Why does the timer have to be on the side nearest the competitor? What if the competitor pops a piece on the other side of the table, goes around to pick it up and chooses to stay on the other side?]
    - 7f2a) Exception: For Solving With Feet, the timer must be placed directly on the floor. The timer device may be placed on the side of the mat farthest from the competitor.
- 7h) The competition area must have a Competitors Area.
  - 7h1) The organisation team may require that a competitor who has been called to compete must remain within the Competitors Area until he has finished all of his attempts for the round.
  - 7h3) Competitors in the Competitors Area must not communicate with each other about the scrambled states of the puzzles of the round in progress. Penalty: disqualification of the competitor from the event, at the discretion of the WCA Delegate.


## Article 8: Competitions

- 8a) An official WCA competition must:
  - 8a1) Be approved by the WCA Board.
  - 8a2) Follow the WCA Regulations.
  - 8a3) Have a designated WCA Delegate in attendance.
  - 8a4) Be announced on the WCA website at least two weeks before the beginning of the competition.
  - 8a6) Be publicly accessible.
  - 8a7) Use the authentic Speed Stacks Stackmat timer (Generation 2 or Pro) for time measurement.
  - 8a8) Be open to all who wish to compete. Restrictions must be approved by the WCA Board and clearly when the competition is announced.
- 8f) If WCA Regulations are not correctly observed during a competition, the WCA Board may disqualify affected attempts.


## Article 9: Events

- 9a) The WCA governs competitions for:
  - 9a1) Puzzles known as Rubik's puzzles. [NOTE: We don’t use all Rubik’s puzzles, so why even have this regulation? Just scrap it and go with 9a2. It should also be pointed out somewhere that only selected puzzles are used, as the way 9a1 and 9a2 are currently worded, it makes it sound like the WCA governs for every twisty puzzle.]
  - 9a2) Other puzzles that are manipulated by twisting the sides, commonly known as "twisty puzzles".
- 9b) The official puzzles and event formats of the WCA are:
  - 9b1) Rubik's Cube, 2x2x2 Cube, 4x4x4 Cube, 5x5x5 Cube, Clock, Magic, Master Magic, Megaminx, Pyraminx, Square-1, and Rubik's Cube: One-Handed.
    - 9b1a) Competition formats for these events are: "Best of X" (where X is 1, 2, or 3), and "Average of 5".
  - 9b2) Rubik's Cube: With Feet, 6x6x6 Cube, and 7x7x7 Cube.
    - 9b2a) Competition formats for these events are: "Best of X" (where X is 1, 2, or 3) and "Mean of 3".
  - 9b3) Rubik's Cube: Fewest Moves, Rubik's Cube: Blindfolded, 4x4x4 Cube: Blindfolded, 5x5x5 Cube: Blindfolded, and Rubik's Cube: Multiple Blindfolded.
    - 9b3a) Competition formats for these events are: "Best of X" (where X is 1, 2, or 3).
- 9e) New official events may be added, and existing official events removed, each calendar year.
  - 9e1) The decision to add or remove an event is made by the WCA Board, based on feedback from the WCA Delegates and the community at large.
- 9f) The results of a round are measured as follows:
  - 9f1) All timed results under 10 minutes are measured and rounded down to the nearest hundredth of a second. All timed averages and means under 10 minutes are measured and rounded to the nearest hundredth of a second. 
  - 9f2) All timed results, averages, and means over 10 minutes are measured and rounded to the nearest second (e.g. x.4 becomes x, x.5 becomes x+1).
  - 9f4) The result of an attempt is recorded as DNF (Did Not Finish) if the attempt is disqualified or unsolved/unfinished.
  - 9f5) The result of an attempt is recorded as DNS (Did Not Start) if the competitor is eligible for an attempt but declines it.
  - 9f6) For "Best of X" rounds, each competitors is allotted X attempts. The best result of these attempts shall count for the competitor's ranking in the round.
  - 9f7) For "Best of X" rounds, a DNF or DNS is the worst possible result.
  - 9f8) For "Average of 5" rounds, competitors are allotted 5 attempts. Of these 5 attempts, the best and worst attempts shall be removed, and the arithmetic mean of the remaining 3 attempts shall count for the competitor's ranking in the round.
  - 9f9) For "Average of 5" rounds, one DNF or DNS is permitted to count as the competitor's worst result of the round. If a competitor receives more than one DNF and/or DNS in the round, his average score for the round is DNF.
  - 9f10) For "Mean of 3" rounds competitors are allotted 3 attempts. The arithmetic mean of the 3 attempts shall count for the competitor's ranking in the round.
  - 9f11) For "Mean of 3" rounds, if the competitor scores at least one DNF or DNS, his average score for the round is DNF.
  - 9f12) For "Best of X" rounds, rankings are assessed based on the best result per competitor. The following shall be used to compare results:
    - 9f12a) For timed results, "better" is defined as the shorter time.
    - 9f12b) For Fewest Moves Solving, "better" is defined as the shorter solution length.
    - 9f12c) For Multiple Blindfolded Solving, rankings are assessed based on number of puzzles solved minus the number of puzzles not solved, where a greater difference is better. If the difference is less than 0, the attempt is considered unsolved (DNF). If competitors achieve the same result, rankings shall be assessed based on total time, where the shorter recorded time is better. If competitors achieve the same result and the same time, rankings shall be assessed based on the number of puzzles the competitors failed to solve, where fewer unsolved puzzles is better.
  - 9f13) For "Mean of 3" and "Average of 5" rounds, rankings are assessed based on the ordering of the averages/means of the competitors, where "better" is the shorter recorded time.
  - 9f14) For "Mean of 3" and "Average of 5" rounds where two or more competitors achieve identical average/mean results, rankings are assessed based on the best result per competitor, where "better" is defined as the shorter time.
  - 9f15) Competitors who achieve the same result in a round receive and identical ranking for the round.
- 9g) A Combined Round consists of two phases of attempts, where competitors advance to the second phase if they meet a designated cutoff during the first phase.
  - 9g2) Whether a competitor proceeds to next phase of a Combined round, must be decided by ranking (best x competitors) or by result (all competitors with a best result under x) of the first phase.
- 9i) Results of official WCA competitions must be listed on the WCA world rankings.
  - 9i1) The WCA shall recognise the following types of regional records: national records, continental records, and world records.
  - 9i2) Results of official WCA competitions are dated to the calendar date of the competition. If a competition spans multiple days, the results of each round are dated to the last scheduled calendar date of the round.
  - 9i3) If the WCA Regulations for an event are changed, existing regional records stand until they are broken under the new WCA Regulations.
- 9j) Each event shall be held at most once per competition.

  - 9m2) Events with 15 or fewer competitors must have at most two rounds.
  - 9m3) Events with 7 or fewer competitors must have at most one round.
- 9o) A Combined rounds and Qualification rounds each count as one round when counting the number of rounds per event.
- 9p) If an event has multiple rounds, then:
  - 9p1) At least 25% of competitors must be eliminated between consecutive rounds of the same event.
  - 9p2) The competitors who advance to the next round must be determined by either a cutoff ranking or a cutoff time in the preceding elimination round. The cutoff must be specified before the preceding elimination round starts.
  - 9p3) If a qualifying competitor withdraws from a round, he may be replaced by the best-ranked competitor below the cutoff from the preceding round.
- 9r) A qualification round must be held before the first round of the event.
  - 9r1) When announcing an event, the organisation team must include:
    - 9r1a) Any limit to the number of competitors permitted in the first round of the event.
    - 9r1b) Any limit to the number of competitors permitted in the qualification round of the event, and any limit tothe maximum number of those competitors who will proceed to the first round.
    - 9r1c) The average/mean result or single solve result, achieved in previous competition, required to qualify directly for the first round of the event.
    - 9r1d) The latest permitted date used to determine the qualifying average/mean result or single solve result on the WCA rankings.
  - 9r2) Each competitor of an event who has not directly qualified for the first round of the event must compete in the qualification round in order to participate in the first round.
  - 9r3) A qualification round may be added to accommodate newly registered competitors, and/or the maximum number of competitors in the qualification round or first round of an event may be increased. These changes must be made at least two weeks before the competition.
- 9s) Each round of each event shall have a time limit (see Regulation A1a).


## Article 10: Solved State

- 10b) Only the resting state of the puzzle, after the timer has been stopped, is considered.
- 10c) The puzzle may be in any orientation at the end of the attempt.
- 10d) All pieces of a puzzle must be fully attached to the puzzle in their required positions. Exceptions: see Article 5. [NOTE: What exceptions? I don’t see any.]
- 10e) A puzzle is solved when all face colours are reassembled and all parts are aligned within the limits specified below:
  - 10e1) For each two adjacent parts (e.g. two parallel, adjacent slices of a cube) of the puzzle that are misaligned more than the limit described in Regulation 10f, the puzzle shall be considered to require one additional move to solve (see "Block Turn Metric" in Article 12).
  - 10e2) If no further moves are required to bring the puzzle to its solved state, the puzzle shall be considered solved without penalty.
  - 10e3) If one move is required, the puzzle shall be considered solved with a time penalty (+2 seconds).
  - 10e4) If more than one move is required, the puzzle shall be considered unsolved (DNF).
- 10f) Limits of acceptable misalignment for puzzles:
  - 10f1) Cube-shaped puzzles: at most 45 degrees.
  - 10f2) Megaminx: at most 36 degrees.
  - 10f3) Pyraminx: at most 60 degrees.
  - 10f4) Square-1: at most 45 degrees (U/D) or 90 degrees (/).
- 10g) For Magic and Master Magic Solving, the minimum acceptable angle between adjacent tiles is 135 degrees.
  - 10g1) If at most two pairs of adjacent tiles are at a smaller angle, and the puzzle is otherwise solved, the puzzle shall be considered solved with a time penalty (+2 seconds). In all other cases, the puzzle is considered unsolved (DNF).
- 10h) Puzzles not specified in this article shall be judged according to the solved state as defined by the generally accepted goal of the puzzle, applying the relevant regulations for the Rubik's Cube.


## Article 11: Incidents

- 11a) Incidents include:
  - 11a1) Incorrect execution of event procedures, by officials or competitors.
  - 11a2) Interference or facility interruptions (e.g. power failure, emergency alarm activation).
  - 11a3) Equipment malfunction.
- 11b) If an incident occurs, the WCA Delegate shall determine an impartial and appropriate course of action.
- 11d) If the WCA Regulations are not fully clear or if the incident is not covered by the WCA Regulations, then the WCA Delegate must make his decision based on fair sportsmanship.
- 11e) If an incident occurs during an attempt, the WCA Delegate may award a competitor an extra attempt, replacing the attempt during which the incident occurred. The competitor must appeal at the time of the incident, before finishing the original attempt, to be eligible for an extra attempt. An appeal does not guarantee the competitor an extra attempt.
  - 11e1) If a competitor is awarded an extra attempt, the extra attempt must be scrambled using a different scramble sequence. This scramble sequence must be generated using the current official version of the official WCA scramble program (see Regulation 4f).
- 11f) The WCA Delegate must not support his decisions with video or photographic analysis. However, a competitor may submit video or photographic evidence supporting an appeal to the WCA Board.


## Article 12: Notation

- 12a) Notation for Rubik's Cube and similar puzzles:
  - 12a1) Face Moves:
    - 12a1a) Clockwise, 90 degrees: F (front face), B (back face), R (right face), L (left face), U (upper face), D (bottom face).
    - 12a1b) Counter clockwise, 90 degrees: F', B', R', L', U', D' (see Regulation 12a1).
    - 12a1c) 180 degrees: F2, B2, R2, L2, U2, D2 (see Regulation 12a1).

## Article A: Speed Solving

- A1) Speed Solving attempts must abide by the following procedure.
  - A1a) The organisation team may enforce time limits for attempts and/or rounds.
    - A1a1) The default time limit per attempt is 10 minutes, though the organisation team may announce a higher/lower time limit.
    - A1a2) Cumulative time limits may be enforced (e.g. 3 attempts with a cumulative time limit of 20 minutes). The time elapsed in a DNF result counts towards the cumulative time limit.
    - A1a3) For each round, any time limits must be announced before the round starts, and should not be changed after it has begun. Changes must be made at the discretion of the WCA Delegate, who shall carefully consider the fairness of the change.
    - A1a4) The competitor must end each attempt within the time limit. If a competitor reaches the time limit for an attempt/round, the judge shall stop the attempt immediately and record the result as DNF. Exception: Multiple Blindfolded Solving (see Regulation H1b1).
    - A1a5) An attempt shall be considered to meet the time limit if and only if the original recorded time, before any time penalties are applied, is strictly less than the time limit. Exception: Multiple Blindfolded Solving (see Regulation H1b1).
  - A1b) If the time limit for an attempt is greater than 10 minutes, a stopwatch must be used for timekeeping.
    - A1b1) Simultaneous use of a Stackmat is optional.
    - A1b2) If the Stackmat time is available, it is the original recorded time. Otherwise, the stopwatch time is the original recorded time.
  - A1c) A competitor participating in an event must be able to fulfill the event's requirements (e.g. know how to solve the puzzle). A competitor competing with expectation of a DNF result may be disqualified from the event, at the discretion of the WCA Delegate.
- A2) Scrambling:
  - A2a) When called for a round, the competitor submits his puzzle, in its solved state, to the scrambler and waits in the Competitors Area until he is called to compete.
  - A2b) A scrambler scrambles the puzzle according to the regulations in Article 4.
  - A2c) After the scrambler starts the scramble, the competitor must not see the puzzle until the inspection phase starts.
  - A2c1) The scrambler places a cover over the scrambled puzzle that makes it impossible for any competitors or spectators to see any part of the puzzle. The cover remains over the puzzle until the beginning of the attempt. [NOTE: I am of the opinion that this rule is pointless, a logistical nightmare, and will come at a further cost to organisers, many of whom are already financially stretched with equipment etc. I wonder what advantage the WRC thinks competitors are getting by being able to glimpse the front of the puzzle? If the competitor really wants an advantage they can just look at their neighbour, who is already inspecting. Having a cover that blocks out the entire cube won’t solve this problem. Essentially, the only purpose this rule could serve is as an attempt to prevent people who might try to cheat from doing so, but it wouldn’t work because there are better ways to cheat. So it creates more problems for everyone else and gives no benefit. Therefore the negatives far outweigh the positives (of which there are none) so this rule should be scrapped. At the very least, if the rule is to stay the WRC should recommend somewhere that organisers can purchase bulk covers of a high quality and at a reasonable price, that serve the purposes required. Finally, I would like some sort of recommendation on how to deal with clocks, which need to be kept covered somehow while staying upright without the pins being adjusted. (And even though I’m not dealing with the guidelines here, “somes” should be “some”).]
  - A2d) When taking a puzzle from the scrambler, the judge briefly inspects the puzzle to ensure thorough scrambling of the puzzle. The judge shall raise any concerns with the scrambler, who shall then conduct a detailed check. [NOTE: What if you have runners? Who inspects? I may as well point out that in light of A2c1 above, this is going to become even more of a nightmare. ]
  - A2e) The judge places the puzzle onto the mat in an arbitrary orientation and ensures that it is covered completely. The competitor is not permitted to request a specific orientation.
- A3) Inspection:
  - A3a) The competitor may inspect the puzzle at the beginning of each attempt.
    - A3a1) The competitor is allotted a maximum of 15 seconds to inspect the puzzle and beginning the solve.
  - A3b) Before the competitor starts the attempt, the judge shall reset the timer and, where applicable, the stopwatch.
    - A3b1) When the judge believes the competitor is ready, he asks "READY?". The competitor must be ready to start the attempt within one minute of being called. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF), at the discretion of the judge. [NOTE: I don’t understand why the penalty would be at the discretion of the judge? The only thing I could think is if the competitor had some need to take longer, such as an emergency toilet stop. If this is the purpose of the disclaimer, or whatever the purpose is meant to be, could it please be put into the guidelines?]
    - A3b2) When the competitor confirms his readiness, the judge uncovers the puzzle. If the attempt requires a stopwatch, the judge starts it at the same time.
  - A3c) The competitor may pick up the puzzle during inspection.
    - A3c1) The competitor must not apply moves during inspection. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
    - A3c2) If the pieces of the puzzle are not fully aligned, then the competitor may align the faces, as long as stays within the limits within the limits described in 10f.
    - A3c3) The competitor may reset the timer before he starts the solve.
  - A3d) At the end of the inspection, the competitor places the puzzle on the mat, in any orientation and position.
    - A3d1) The puzzle must not rest on the timer. Penalty: time penalty (+2 seconds).
    - A3d2) When 8 seconds of inspection have elapsed, the judge calls "8 SECONDS".
    - A3d3) When 12 seconds of inspection have elapsed, the judge calls "GO", and the competitor shall start the solve.
- A4) Starting the solve:
  - A4b) The competitor places his hands on the elevated sensor unit of the timer, with his fingers touching the sensors and palms down. Penalty: time penalty (+2 seconds).
    - A4b1) The competitor must have no physical contact with the puzzle between the inspection period and the beginning of the solve. Penalty: time penalty (+2 seconds).
  - A4d) The competitor starts the solve by confirming that the timer light is green and then removing his hands from the timer, thus starting the timer.
    - A4d1) The competitor must start the solve within 15 seconds of the beginning of the inspection. Penalty: time penalty (+2 seconds). [NOTE: I think a definition is needed for “light” and “dark”. Is bright orange lighter than sky blue? Perhaps the colour spectrum would be a good reference. Another thing, I may as well put in here, I have to be perfectly honest in my opinion that I think this is a really poor decision not to allow replacing black for white in direct cases. If we are going with this then it will create even more discrepancy in chosen scrambling orientation, depending on what people think is “light” (and “dark”). This makes it even more important to come up with a solid definition for these terms.]
    - A4d2) The competitor must start the solve within 17 seconds of the beginning of the inspection. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
  - A4e) Time penalties for starting the solve are cumulative.
- A5) During the solve:
  - A5a) While inspecting or solving the puzzle, the competitor must not communicate with anyone other than the judge. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
  - A5b) While inspecting or solving the puzzle, the competitor must not receive assistance from anyone or any object other than the surface. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
- A6) Stopping the solve:
  - A6a) The competitor stops the solve by releasing the puzzle and then stopping the timer.
    - A6a1) If a stopwatch is in use as the timing device, the competitor ends the solve by releasing the puzzle and notifying the judge that he has stopped the solve.
    - A6a2) When using a stopwatch without a Stackmat, the competitor's default notification signal consists of releasing the puzzle(s) in his hand and placing his hands on the surface, with palms down. The competitor and the judge may agree on another appropriate notification before the beginning of the solve.
  - A6b) The competitor is responsible for stopping the timer correctly.
    - A6b1) If the timer stops before the end of the solve and the timer shows a time strictly below 0.06 seconds, then the attempt shall be replaced by an extra attempt. A competitor forfeits his right to the additional attempt if the WCA Delegate determines that the timer was stopped deliberately.
    - A6b2) If the timer stops before the end of the solve and displays a time of 0.06 seconds or higher, then the attempt shall be disqualified (DNF). Exception: if the competitor can demonstrate that the timer malfunctioned, he may receive an extra attempt, at the WCA Delegate's discretion.
  - A6c) The competitor must stop the timer using both hands, placed flat on the sensors with palms down. Penalty: time penalty (+2 seconds).
  - A6d) The competitor must fully release the puzzle before stopping the timer. Penalty: time penalty (+2 seconds).
  - A6e) The competitor must not touch or move the puzzle until the judge has inspected the puzzle. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF). Exception: If no moves have been applied, a time penalty (+2 seconds) may be assigned instead, at the discretion of the judge. [NOTE: I’m not against the “exception”, I’m just concerned about it being applied inconsistently without specific guidance on what might be a suitable exception. For example, if the puzzle is about to roll off the table is that ok? Some people might DNF that, others might +2 it. What about if there is a face that is close to being a +2 penalty for a misaligned slice? If the competitor touches it without adjusting that face at all, I could imagine some judges would not be happy with them touching and DNF it, and others would say it wasn’t too problematic and only +2 them. It would be good to have guidelines on this.]
  - A6f) The competitor must not reset the timer until the judge has recorded the result on the score sheet. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF), at the discretion of the judge.
  - A6g) The judge determines whether the puzzle is solved. He must not make moves or align faces when examining the puzzle.
  - A6h) In case of a dispute, moves or alignments must not be applied to the puzzle before the dispute is resolved. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF), at the discretion of the WCA Delegate.
  - A6i) Time penalties for stopping the solve are cumulative.
- A7) Recording results:
  - A7a) If the judge finds that the puzzle is solved, he calls "OK".
  - A7b) The judge records the result on a score sheet.
    - A7b1) If penalties are assigned, the judge records the original recorded result displayed on the timer, along with any penalties. The format is "X + T + Y = F", where X represents the sum of time penalties before/starting the solve, T represents the time displayed on the timer, Y represents a sum of time penalties during/after the solve, and F represents the final result. If X and/or Y is 0, the 0 terms are omitted (e.g. 2 + 17.65 + 2 = 21.65, or 17.65 + 2 = 19.65). [NOTE: Why have an order for penalties? I can only imagine this creating confusion, and it adds no value to the information being supplied. ]
  - A7c) The judge and competitor must both sign the score sheet to acknowledge the result.
    - A7c1) If the competitor or the judge refuses to sign the score sheet, the WCA Delegate may sign in their place. [NOTE: Why can the delegate sign for them? In what cases would this be an acceptable course of action? The only reason a competitor would refuse to sign is if there was a dispute, and that should be resolved first anyway. I don’t know why a judge would refuse to sign at all. Whatever the reason for this regulation being put in, there should be some guideline as to what it’s all about.]
  - A7d) If the judge assigns a penalty, the judge shall call "PENALTY". [NOTE: Can their be some disclaimer that the judge is allowed to explain the penalty? Also, what if there are multiple penalties? “PENALTY, PENALTY, PENALTY” :p]
  - A7e) If the result is DNF, then judge shall call "DNF". [NOTE: Same as above; can the judge explain?]
  - A7f) When a competitor's score sheet for a round is complete, the judge shall deliver the score sheet to the score taker. [NOTE: What if there are runners?]

  - C1b) During the solve, the competitor must use only one hand to touch the puzzle. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
    - C1b2) If a puzzle defect occurs, and the competitor chooses to repair it, he must repair it using only the solving hand. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
    - C1b3) If a puzzle defect occurs, and pieces of the puzzle briefly come in contact with other body parts without the competitor's intention, this is not considered touching the puzzle, at the discretion of the judge.
  - C1c) During the solve, once a competitor touches the puzzle with one hand, he must not touch the puzzle with the other hand. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).

- D1) Standard speed solving procedures shall be followed, as described in Article A (Speed Solving). Additional regulations that supersede the corresponding procedures in Article A are described below.
  - D1a) During the attempt, the competitor must sit in a chair, sit on the surface, or stand. [NOTE: I don’t see the need for this regulation. Why can’t the competitor solve with feet while lying down? Or in a handstand? They can solve any other event any way they like, so I don’t see why this event is restricted in this way. ]
  - D1b) During the attempt, the competitor must only use his feet and the surface. The competitor may wear socks while solving. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
  - D1c) During the solve, the competitor must use only his feet to touch the puzzle. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
- D3) Starting the solve:
  - D3a) The competitor places his feet onto the timer sensors. [NOTE: I never thought about this before (thankfully it’s never been a problem at Australian competitions), but if hand events must be started with fingers on the sensors, should feet be started with toes? Or are heels ok?]
  - D3b) The competitor removes his feet from the timer sensors to start the solve.
- D4) Stopping the solve:
  - D4a) The competitor stops the timer by placing his feet onto the timer sensors.
