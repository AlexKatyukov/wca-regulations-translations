# Notes on the Regulations

Quick notes for revision.

## To Be Discussed by the WCA Board / WRC

- How official scrambling programs are decided made available.
- When may rounds be added to an event, and what is allowed?
- We need an impartial list of valid citizenships that will stay updated without requiring political decisions by the WCA.

## For Website formatting
- Table of contents
- Cross-links for certain terms

## Specific Regulations

- 1b2) parentheses sbould be moved to Guidelines?
- Still need to fix English in Articles 10, 12. (e.g. 10h)
- Article 5: fix formatting
- Guideline 8a4)
- Rephrase the intro to Article Z, and try to find some way to number it.
- Make 9b) more DRY.
- 11e1 is missing (should have a strongly worded reminder and a reference to 4f)
- 10f)
- 10g) "degree" still not fixed?
- E3) still missing sub-regulation numberings

## General Notes

- For anything might make a reader think "Why is it phrased like that?", ther should be another Regulation / Guideline, or some note should be made in the style guide to clarify that some particular choice of phrasing was on purpose.
- Consistent bulleting (along with punctuation, e.g. commas and colons at the end of lines)
- Suspension isn't defined; what are the rights of the board to deal with competitors / community members / incidents
- There's no consistent place for all he things that are "provided by" the judge / organization team.
- Specify roles instead of "X must be made to happen" or "The competitor should submit X cubes"
- Single-corner Twists
  - By the scrambler
  - By the competitor, on purpose
  - By the competitor, by accident
- Run everything through some spell- and grammar-checkers
- 9i is out of place.
- Remove "(Draft)" from the titles.
- Mention the Guidelines in the Regulations (e.g. with Delegate's tasks)
- British English
- Mark [CLARIFICATION] vs. [EXAMPLE] vs. [RECOMMENDATION]
- Find some way to make misalignment rulings from 10f clear without images.
- Still need a justification of video evidence frmo the board fo 11f
- Competing in a round outside of the regular time frame
  - Systematic exceptions: judges round, accomodtions for event conflicts
  - Special exceptions: competitors leaving early / arriving late (whether their fault or not), individual organisers going at irregular times to facilitate organisation / scheduling
- Bathroom breaks for multi BLD: Have those ever been allowed?

## Guidelines to Add

- Ron's policy of putting cubers in contact with media requests, not the other way around
- Guideline: Cubes may be of any reasonable size

## Things to put in the Style Guide

- For most formatting questions, see current Regulations: serial comma, contractions, use of i.e. and e.g., listing examples (in parentheses or bullets), capitalizations, no tabs
- Capitalization of event names and e.g. committees
- Mention how experience has shown tht we need to cover all contingencies instead of trusting things too much. That said, the delegate can handle most exceptions.
- Spelling of terms like "Competitors Area"

## Consistency of Terminology

- A "regulation" vs. a "rule"
- "score" vs. "results" vs. "time"
- event vs. round vs. group (i.e. which one is a judge assigned to?)
- Records vs. results, and recognition (vs. ranking, e..g WR on site)
- rank vs. ranking vs. position
- registration vs. pre-registration
- eligible vs. permitted vs. allowed
- solve vs. attempt vs. competing (vs. active competitor)
  - Attempt: everything from handing the cube to the scrambler to signing the scoresheet? (Vincent: Use "attempt" whever possible?)
  - Solve: The timed portion of an attempt (note: this definition might be strained for FMC, BLD, or other potential events). (Does this include inspection?)
  - See A6a2 for a place where we need to describe something inbetween: puzzle possibly already scrambled, but solve not begun yet. Also, BLD has inspection/memorization and solving
- scramble vs. scramble sequence
- From the forum: disqualification > DNF? "penalty : disqualification of the solve (DNF)" ? ( http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=1022&p=5867#p5867 )
  - Formatting idea:  "Penalty: 2 second time penalty" and "Penalty: disqualification (DNF)"
- competition date?
- "start" vs. "begin"
- score sheet vs. scoresheet vs. scorecard vs. competition sheet. How about something that is more accurate, like "time sheet" or "time card" or "result sheet"? (see "score" vs. "results" vs. "time")
- plural adjectival nouns "Regulations Committee", "results sheet"
- "give" vs. "apply" vs. "assign" a penalty
- listing alternatives (A7b vs. 1b2)
- "writing down" vs. "recording" a result
- "The competitor must" vs. "a competitor must" vs. "competitors must" vs. "each / every competitor must" vs. "all competitors must"
- thereby vs. thus (i.e. "thereby starting the timer")
- Rules about covers
- Stackmat vs. Stackmat timer vs. Stackmat (i.e. the mat)
- "the X" vs. "a X" (e.g. X = blindfold)
- such taht vs. so that
- "apply" a move vs. "make" a move
- consent vs. discretion of the delegate
- stop vs. end vs. completion of the solve / attempt
- All event names (particularly feet, multi BLD, and OH)
- Guidelines: Explicitly label each rule with "Clarification" / "Explanation" / etc.

## Consistency of Grammar

- Consistent use of consecutive "and"s/"or"s, with serial comma.
- Consistent examples in parentheses.
- Use "discretion" instead of "courtesy"
- Consistent use of "If x is the case" vs. "Should x be the case" (I think "if" is equally clear, and simpler.)
- Consistent capitalization and full use of "WCA Regulations"
- ALL OVER THE PLACE: Singular vs. plural
- Each vs. all vs. every
- "allotted"
- Passive/active voice, descriptive vs. prescriptive, past vs. present

## Keep it simple, and in line with the past where possible.

- While "If ... in a solve, then ... in said solve." might be more accurate, I think "the" instead of "said" is simpler and just as clear in most cases.
- Sarah had an interesting qualification / elimination round distinction, but I've removed it because 1) it doesn't fit our usual way of talking about things, 2) if there's only one round, there is no elimination, and 3) "elimination" sounds a little negative for the spirit of the WCA.
- Keep it DRY.

## Consistent Formatting

- be consistent about "x" in round formats.
- For each type of round and type of event, define the result used for ranking, and what counts as "better"
- Normalize penalties and the Regulations mention them ("disqualification of the attempt", not "solve")
- A two-second penalty should be written as "+2" in quotes.
- Every rule in a section is not indented. Every subrule is indented exactly four spaces, no matter how deeply nested. This was a good choice by ClÃ©ment.
- Incidents? Maybe make it a technical term based on the Constitution, and capitalize it?
- Four-space indentation, make sure to spell-check and check for accidental double-spaces ("  ")
- "default" procedures
- Mention of stopwatch in relation to timer regulations
- Book-style capitalization of section titles (Also, consistent colons)
- Capitalizatino of hyphenated words, e.g. "Foot solving" vs. "Foot Solving" at the beginning of a sentence, or "One-Handed" vs. "One-handed"
- Formatting of the articles for the events, e.g. "Scrambling" and "Inspection" headings
- The subject material of a Regulation should be at the front, even if it might be grammatically neater to put it last. (Think: someone will be scanning the first few words of each line.)
- "WCA Delegate", not just "Delegate"
- Regexes:
    - "said" > "the"
    - four spaces and nothing else on a line
    - too much indentation
    - blank spaces at the end of a line
- Formatting of tables and images-
- Emphasize cubing terms *like this* or _like this_?

## WCA Constitution

- Misformatted indentation, e.g. 2a2)
- Any way we can combine the mission and the spirit?
- 2b2b) Does the Board + WCA Chairman count as a single body for deciding WRC members?
- 3a2b1) "supersede" is the more common spelling?
- 3a2b1) may take immediate effect after they've been passed? Can the Board set the changes to go into effect at a certain time?
- "Sponsorship" doesn't sound quite right for WCA overview of a competition.
- 2d1: extra period at end
- 3b1b) Must contain all normative rules??
- There are a lot of "shall"s. Some could be changed to "are" or removed.
- 3c1a) All... competition incidents? It coule be that non-competition event merit a clarification in the log. Also, perhaps it would make sense to talk about both the log and whatever we call announcements about Regulation changes / updates.
- 3c2a2) The WRC should be reporting all major incidents, i.e. "descriptions of the incident, its circumstances, and its resolution". Clarify the distinction for announcements by the Board vs. log entries by the WRC?

## Guidelines

- Guideline about what (version of their) name competitors may/must provide?
