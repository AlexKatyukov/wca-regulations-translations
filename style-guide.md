# Style Guide and Comments on the WCA Regulations

This document is meant to clarify some of the implicit conventions adopted in WCA documents.

## General Information

- The documents are formatted in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), a plain-text format created by John Gruber. This makes it easy to focus on the raw text (and any changes), so that it is readable on its own and can also be converted into a fancier format (i.e. HTML).

## Formatting Conventions

- References to the "(WCA) Regulations" and "(WCA) Guidelines" should be capitalized. For example, Regulation 1a) is a regulation in the Regulations. This makes it clear that "Regulations" refers to the body of the WCA Regulations.

### Specific Formatting in Markdown.

- The Regulations should limit itself to standard ASCII, for maximum encoding compatibility. This facilitates safe conversion and parsing.
    - "Degrees" should be spelled out instead of using the degree sign.
