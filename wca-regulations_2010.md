- 9e) New official events may be added each calendar year, and existing official events may be removed.
    - 9e1) The decision to add or remove an event is made by the WCA Board, based on feedback by the community.
    - 9e4) Other events may be held during a competition, but will be unofficial and therefore not part of the official results of the competition.
- 9f) The results of a round are measured as follows:
    - 9f1) All timed results under 10 minutes, and corresponding averages/means are measured in hundredths of a second, with averages/means rounded to the nearest hundredth of a second (x.004 becomes x.00, x.005 becomes x.01).
    - 9f2) All timed results over 10 minutes, and corresponding averages/means are measured in seconds, with averages/means rounded to the nearest second (x.4 becomes x, x.5 becomes x+1).
    - 9f3) All counted results and averages/means are measured in natural numbers, with averages/means rounded to the nearest tenth (x.04 becomes x.0, x.05 becomes x.1).
    - 9f4) DNF (Did Not Finish) is the result if the solve was disqualified or unfinished.
    - 9f5) DNS (Did Not Start) is the result if a competitor skipped an attempt in a round.
    - 9f6) In 'Best of x' rounds competitors get x (<= 3) attempts, with the best attempt counting. There may be a combined time limit, example: 30 minutes for 'Best of 1' or 'Best of 2'.
    - 9f7) In 'Best of x' rounds a DNF or DNS is the worst result of a competitor, if all results are DNF and/or DNS the best result of the competitor is DNF.
    - 9f8) In 'Average of 5' rounds competitors get 5 attempts. Of these 5 attempts, the best and worst attempt are removed, with the mean of the remaining 3 attempts counting.
    - 9f9) In 'Average of 5' rounds one DNF or DNS is counted as the worst result, with more than one DNF and/or DNS the average is DNF.
    - 9f10) In 'Mean of 3' rounds competitors get 3 attempts, with the mean of the 3 attempts counting.
    - 9f11) In 'Mean of 3' rounds if the competitor has at least one DNF or DNS the mean is DNF.
    - 9f12) In 'Best of x' rounds the order in the results is based on the best result per competitor, with lower meaning better.
    - 9f13) In 'Mean of' and 'Average of' rounds the order in the results is based on the best average/mean per competitor, with lower meaning better.
    - 9f14) If in 'Mean of' and 'Average of' rounds competitors have the same average/mean result, then the order in the results for these competitors is based on the best result per competitor, with lower meaning better.
    - 9f15) Competitors with the same result in a round finish at the same position.
    - 9f16) For the Rubik's Cube: Multiple Blindfolded event the order in the results is based on number of puzzles solved minus the number of puzzles not solved (higher is better). If the result is lower than 0, the solve is disqualified. If competitors have the same result, then the order is based on total time (lower is better).
- 9g) A Combined round is two or three rounds combined during one time frame, where results of earlier rounds are taken into account for next rounds.
    - 9g1) A Combined round can be used to save time in the time schedule.
    - 9g2) Whether a competitor proceeds to next phase of a Combined round, must be decided on position (best x competitors) or on result (all competitors with a best result under x).
- 9h) WCA must provide WCA world rankings for single and preferred average/mean formats where applicable.
- 9i) Results of official WCA competitions must be listed on the WCA world rankings, if the full WCA regulations were applied.

    - 9p1) For each round of an event, at least 25% of the competitors must not proceed to the next round.
    - 9p2) Either the best x competitors proceed to the next round, or all competitors who beat a specific result (announced before the round).
- 9q) Events and rounds should have at least 2 competitors.
- 9r) A qualification round is a round of an event held before the first round of the event. The goal of a qualification round is to let unranked or low ranked competitors qualify for the first round of an event with many registered competitors.
    - 9r1) When announcing the competition the organisation team must announce:
        - how many competitors will compete in the first round of the event
        - the maximum number of competitors in the qualification round of the event, and how many of the competitors will proceed to the first round
        - which average/mean time or single solve time for the WCA ranking of the event is required to directly qualify for the first round (or other round) of the event
        - the date taken for deciding the average/mean time or single solve time on the WCA ranking of each competitor
    - 9r2) All competitors of an event who are not directly qualified for the first round of the event, must compete in the qualification round of the event.
    - 9r3) There may be changes to increase the maximum number of competitors in qualification round or first round, or to add a qualification round for newly registered competitors. These changes should be made at least one month before the competition.
- 9s) If during a round a competitor does not solve within the time limit, then his solve may (courtesy of main judge) be stopped and disqualified by the judge. The main judge decides whether the competitor may continue the round, for example if the time was exceeded because of a puzzle defect.

## Article 10: Solved state
- 10b) Only the resting state of a puzzle is considered, when the timer has stopped.
- 10c) Puzzles may be in any orientation at the end of the solve.
- 10d) All pieces of a puzzle must be fully attached to the puzzle, and in their required positions. Exceptions: see Article 5 Puzzle defects.
- 10e) A puzzle is solved when all face colours are reconstructed and all the parts are aligned within certain limits.
    - 10e1) For each two adjacent parts (for example two parallel adjacent slices of a cube) of the puzzle that are misaligned more than the limit described in Article 10f, these two parts are considered to need one move to be solved (Half Turn Metric).
    - 10e2) If no move is needed to bring the puzzle to solved state, the puzzle is considered solved without a penalty.
    - 10e3) If one move is needed, the puzzle is considered solved with a penalty of 2 seconds.
    - 10e4) If more than one move is needed, the solve is ruled DNF.
- 10f) Limits of misalignment for puzzles:
    - cube shaped puzzles: =< 45 degrees
    - Megaminx: =< 36 degrees
    - Pyraminx: =< 60 degrees
    - Square-1: =< 45 degrees (U/D) or 90 degrees (/)
    
Examples:

Solved = no penalty
Misalignment <= 45° Solved, with penalty
Only 2 adjacent parts misaligned > 45° Not solved
2 misalignments > 45°

Solved, with penalty
1 misalignment > 45° Solved = no penalty
All misalignments <= 45° Solved = no penalty
Misalignment <= 45°

Not solved
2 misalignments > 45° Solved = no penalty
All misalignments <= 45° Solved, with penalty
1 misalignment > 45°

- 10g) For Magic (and similar puzzles) the puzzle must be flat on the surface. The minimum angle that tiles must have compared to the connecting tiles is 135°.
    - 10g1) If one or two pairs of connecting tiles have a smaller angle with each other, and the puzzle is otherwise solved, then the puzzle is considered solved, with a penalty of 2 seconds. In all other cases the result is DNF.
- 10h) Other puzzles are solved according to the solved state as defined in the generally accepted goal of the puzzle, with the regulations of the cube solved state applied when applicable.

## Article 11: Incidents
- 11a) Incidents are:
    - 11a1) Incorrect execution of event procedures, by officials or competitors.
