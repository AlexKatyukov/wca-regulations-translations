# Translation Instructions

If you'd like to (re)-translate the Regulations, please use the following process:

- Download the [source of the current official Regulations](https://github.com/cubing/wca-documents/archive/official.zip).
    - When you do this, please also visit [the GitHub page](https://github.com/cubing/wca-documents) and record the current "latest commit" value so we can tell which version you translated.
- Translate `wca-guidelines.md` and `wca-regulations.md`
   - Try to keep all the formatting intact and only change the words.
    - Read through the [style guide](https://github.com/cubing/wca-documents-extra/blob/master/style-guide.md) for detailed information about how the Regulations are formatted.
    - Add a section at the top of the Regulations called "Translation", which should include any useful information about the translation, as well as a translation of the following text:

> Please note that this translations is not an official version (even though it is provided on the WCA website): it may be useful, but it does not come with any guarantees. If there is a difference between a translation and the (current official) English version, the English version must be used.

 - Contact the [WRC](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/contact/wrc) for adding your translations to the GitHub repository and uploading them to the WCA website. Please sent us:
    - The translated Regulations and Guidelines.
    - The "latest commit" value your translation is based on.
    - The names of the translators, along with WCA IDs, and (optionally) personal homepages to link from this page.
    - Translations of the following:
        - The native name of your translation language, in that language.
        - The words/phrases for "Regulations" and "Guidelines".
        - A suitable translation of the file name `wca-regulations-and-guidelines.pdf` for downloads (preferably without accent marks or special letters).

All translations will be kept [on GitHub](https://github.com/cubing/wca-documents-translations).
If you're familiar with `git`/GitHub, you're also welcome to fork the [`wca-documents-translations`](https://github.com/cubing/wca-documents-translations) repository. This makes it easy for the WRC to track changes in your translation.

If you're not familiar with GitHub, just send us your translated files via email.
