## Corresponding to Regulations

    - 1c3) [CORRESPONDING] Results should be ready at the end of the last day of competition.
    - 1c4) [CORRESPONDING] Corrections to the results should be available within one week of the competition date.

1h) [CORRESPONDING] All final rounds of all events, as well as all Fewst Moves Solving rounds, should have the same scrambles for all competitors (i.e. only 1 heat).

- 2d) [CORRESPONDING] Guideline: Date of birth and contact information should be especially secured. Also, Ron's policy of askinging the competitor before putting them in contact with e.g. media.

    - 3a1) [CORRESPONDING] Competitors may be disqualified if they do not come when they are called, or if they do not have a puzzle ready to submit.
- 3i) [CORRESPONDING] Examples of such enhancement include: new moves are possible, normal moves are impossible, more pieces or faces are visible, colours on the backside of the puzzle are visible, moves are done automatically, more or other solved states. [ACTION: Move examples to Guidelines]

- 4b) [CORRESPONDING] Delegates must never re-generate any scrambles to replace other ones for the purpose of filtering. For example, it is not be permitted to glance at the scrambles for a competition and generate the entire set again in order to generate 'fairer' scrambles.

    - 5b5) [CORRESPONDING] Example of a piece not fully placed: a 5x5x5 centre piece twisted in its spot
    - 5b5) [CORRESPONDING] Example of judging an attempt ending with a defective puzzle: A pyraminx with a detached tip may be reassembled in three states, one fully solved, and two "+2" states. A solve ending in such a position would be assigned a "+2" penalty.

- 4f) The WCA Delegate should generate sufficient scrambles for the entire compeitition ahead of time, including spare scrambles for extra attempts. If he generates any additional scrambles, he must save them (see 1c3a in the Regulations).

## Article 6: Awards/prizes/honours
- 6a) [SEPARATE] Awards, prizes or honours may be given to competitors according to the announcement of the competition.

    - B1b2) [SEPARATE] Blindfolds should be checked by the WCA Delegate before use in the competition.

10f) [CORRESPONDING] The misalignment limits are selected so that they provide a natural cutoff between one state of a puzzle (without penalty) and a state one move away.

    - 11e1) [CORRSPONDING]

11f) [CORRESPONDING] [NOTE: We need the board to give us a good justification for the video evidence rule.]

A1a3) [CORRESPONDING] The organisation team and the WCA Delegate must be mindful that time limits influence the strategies of the competitors (e.g. rushing the first two solves in hopes of meeting a cutoff in a combined round), and that changing time limits after the beginning of the round can disadvantage some competitors unfairly.
A6b) [CORRESPONDING] The arbitrary value of 0.06 seconds was chosen to accomodate concerns about Stackmat timers.

D1c) [CORRESPONDING] This rule still applies while repairing puzzle defects.

H1b1) [CORRESPONDING] The judge may allow the competitor to keep solving unofficially, but the attempt must be interrupted and finished first, in full accordance with the Regulations.
