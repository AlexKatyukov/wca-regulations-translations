# WCA Guidelines 2012 (Draft)

The WCA Guidelines supplement the WCA Regulations. Guidelines are numbered in correspondence with related regulations.

Note the following:
- Mutiple guidelines may correspond to the same Regulation.
- Several guidelines were moved from a previous version of the Regulations, with their numbering preserved (and therefore are not numbered correspond to an existing Regulation). These are marked with [SEPARATE]
- For informational reasons, each Guideline is classified using one of the following labels. Note that this should be treated as metadata, not a description of importance.
  - [ADDITION] Additional information to supplement the Regulations.
  - [CLARIFICATION] Information to address any possible questions about interpretation of the Regulations.
  - [EXPLANATION] Information that clarifies the intent of Regulations.
  - [RECOMMENDATION] Something that is not strictly mandatory, but that should be done if possible.
  - [REMINDER] Information that may be addressed other Regulations/Guideline, but whose relevance is worth reiterating.


## Article 1: Officials

1h1) [CLARIFICATION] Judges should not start judging other competitors in their own heat before they have finished all their attempts. Sometimes it is useful to permit judges to start judging other competitors in their own heat before they have completed all their attempts, but the organization team must ensure that no judge is able to see a scramble for one of their attempts before they attempt it.


## Article 2: Competitors

- 2c) [ADDITION] First-time competitors should register using their legal name. They may register using a reasonable nickname, at the discretion of the Delegate.

- 2d) [ADDITION] Date of birth and contact information should be especially secured.
- 2d) [RECOMMENDATION] If a third party (e.g. journalist) asks the organisation team to be put in contact with any competitors, the competitor should first be asked for consent.
- 2h1) [CLARIFICATION] Competitors may be barefoot for Solving With Feet.
- 2j2) [EXAMPLE] For example, if a competitor is disqualified from an event for failing to show up for the final round, his results from earlier rounds remain valid.

## Article 4: Scrambling

- 4b) [REMINDER] Delegates must never re-generate any scrambles to replace other ones for the purpose of filtering. For example, it is not be permitted to glance at the scrambles for a competition and generate the entire set again in order to generate 'fairer' scrambles.
- 4f) [RECOMMENDATION] The WCA Delegate should generate sufficient scrambles for the entire competition ahead of time, including spare scrambles for extra attempts.
- 4f) [REMINDER] If the Delegate generates any additional scrambles during the competition, he must save them (see Regulation 1c3a).


## Article 5: Puzzle Defects

- 5b5) [EXAMPLE] Example of a piece not fully placed: a 5x5x5 centre piece twisted in its spot
- 5b5) [EXAMPLE] Example of judging an attempt ending with a defective puzzle: A pyraminx with a detached tip may be reassembled in three states, one fully solved, and two "+2" states. An attempt ending in such a position would be assigned a "+2" penalty.

## Article 10: Solved State

- 10f) [EXPLANATION] The misalignment limits are selected so that they provide a natural cutoff between one state of a puzzle (without penalty) and a state one move away.
- 10f) [EXAMPLE] Examples of judging misalignments:

Solved = no penalty
Misalignment <= 45 degrees: Solved, with penalty
Only 2 adjacent parts misaligned > 45 degrees: Not solved
2 misalignments > 45 degrees

Solved, with penalty
1 misalignment > 45 degrees: Solved = no penalty
All misalignments <= 45 degrees: Solved = no penalty
Misalignment <= 45 degrees

Not solved
2 misalignments > 45 degrees: Solved = no penalty
All misalignments <= 45 degrees: Solved, with penalty
1 misalignment > 45 degrees


## Article 11: Incidents

- 11e) [CLARIFICATION] Since an appeal is not guaranteed to be successful, the competitor may choose to keep the timer running while appealing it, and resume the attempt when appropriate.

## Article A: Speed Solving

- A1a2) [ADDITION] In case of a cumulative time limit, the judge shall record the original recorded time for a DNF on the score sheet in parentheses, e.g. 'DNF (1:02.27)'.
- A1a3) [REMINDER] The organisation team and the WCA Delegate must be mindful that time limits influence the strategies of the competitors (e.g. rushing the first two attempts in hopes of meeting a cutoff in a combined round), and that changing time limits after the start of the round can disadvantage some competitors unfairly.
- A1a4) [REMINDER] If a competitor has accidentally been permitted to exceed the time limit, the time limit must be enforced retroactively, and the judge, competitor, and Delegate should be informed (see Regulation 1g2). Judges should always be aware of the time limit for a current attempt (which might depend on previous attempts, in the case of a cumulative time limit).
- A1a5) [CLARIFICATION] Since it is only required that the original recorded time must be under the time limit, the result for an attempt may be over the time limit after time penalties are assigned.
- A2c1) [CLARIFICATION] In the past, score cards have been used to cover puzzles while leaving somes sides exposed. This is no longer permitted.
- A3c3) [CLARIFICATION] Although the judge is require to reset the timer for the competitor (see Regulation A3b), the competitor may reset it during inspection if the judge neglected to do so.

- H1d) [EXAMPLE] Example: If a competitor attempts 10 cubes, finishes with a time of 59:57, and has two time penalties, the result is 59:57 + 2*2 = 60:01 (also see Guideline A1a5).
- H1d) [EXAMPLE] Example: If a competitor attempts 10 cubes, finishes with a time of 59:57, and has two time penalties, the result is 59:57 + 2*2 = 60:01 (also see Guideline A1a5).
