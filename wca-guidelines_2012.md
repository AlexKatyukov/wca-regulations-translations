# WCA Guidelines 2012 (Draft)

The WCA Guidelines supplement the WCA Regulations. Guidelines are numbered in correspondence with related regulations.


## Article 1: Officials

    - 1b2) [CORRESPONDING] It is sufficient to ensure access to a digital copy of the Regulations.
    - 1c3) [CORRESPONDING] Results should be ready at the end of the last day of competition.
    - 1c4) [CORRESPONDING] Corrections to the results should be available within one week of the competition date.

1h) [CORRESPONDING] All final rounds of all events, as well as all Fewest Moves Solving rounds, should have the same scrambles for all competitors (i.e. only 1 heat).


## Article 2: Competitors

- 2c) [CORRESPONDING] First-time competitors should register using their legal name. They may register using a reasonable nickname, at the discretion of the Delegate.
- 2c) [CORRESPONDING] Competitors must not provide intentionally misleading information, and returning competitors should provide information consistent with past information (e.g. exact name and WCA ID).
- 2d) [CORRESPONDING] Date of birth and contact information should be especially secured.
- 2d [CORRESPONDING] If a third party (e.g. journalist) asks the organisation team to be put in contact with any competitors, the competitor should first be asked for consent.

    - 3a1) [CORRESPONDING] Competitors may be disqualified if they do not come when they are called, or if they do not have a puzzle ready to submit.


## Article 3: Puzzles

- 3c) [CORRESPONDING] Competitors may use puzzles of any reasonable size, at the discretion of the Delegate.
- 3i) [CORRESPONDING] Examples of such enhancement include: new moves are possible, normal moves are impossible, more pieces or faces are visible, colours on the backside of the puzzle are visible, moves are done automatically, more or other solved states.


## Article 4: Scrambling

- 4b) [CORRESPONDING] Delegates must never re-generate any scrambles to replace other ones for the purpose of filtering. For example, it is not be permitted to glance at the scrambles for a competition and generate the entire set again in order to generate 'fairer' scrambles.

    - 5b5) [CORRESPONDING] Example of a piece not fully placed: a 5x5x5 centre piece twisted in its spot
    - 5b5) [CORRESPONDING] Example of judging an attempt ending with a defective puzzle: A pyraminx with a detached tip may be reassembled in three states, one fully solved, and two "+2" states. A solve ending in such a position would be assigned a "+2" penalty.

- 4f) [CORRESPONDING] The WCA Delegate should generate sufficient scrambles for the entire competition ahead of time, including spare scrambles for extra attempts. If he generates any additional scrambles during the competition, he must save them (see Regulation 1c3a).


## Article 6: Awards/prizes/honours

- 6a) [SEPARATE] Awards, prizes or honours may be given to competitors according to the announcement of the competition.
- 6b) [SEPARATE] Competitors should attend the winner's ceremony to receive awards/prizes/honours.

    - 8a4) [CORRESPONDING] A competition should be announced at least one month before the competition starts.
    - 8a5) [CORRESPONDING] The competition should have at least 12 competitors.


## Article 9: Events

    - 9e4) Events other than those specified in article 9b may be held during a competition, but will be considered unofficial and therefore will not be included in the official results of the competition.
- 9q) [SEPARATE] Events and rounds should have at least 2 competitors.
- 9r) [SEPARATE] The goal of a qualification round is to let unranked or low ranked competitors qualify for the first round of an event with many registered competitors.

    - B1b2) [SEPARATE] Blindfolds should be checked by the WCA Delegate before use in the competition.


## Article 10: Solved state

10f) [CORRESPONDING] The misalignment limits are selected so that they provide a natural cutoff between one state of a puzzle (without penalty) and a state one move away.
10f) Examples of judging misalignments

Solved = no penalty
Misalignment <= 45 degrees: Solved, with penalty
Only 2 adjacent parts misaligned > 45 degrees: Not solved
2 misalignments > 45 degrees

Solved, with penalty
1 misalignment > 45 degrees: Solved = no penalty
All misalignments <= 45 degrees: Solved = no penalty
Misalignment <= 45 degrees

Not solved
2 misalignments > 45 degrees: Solved = no penalty
All misalignments <= 45 degrees: Solved, with penalty
1 misalignment > 45 degrees


## Article 11: Incidents

11e) [CORRESPONDING] Since an appeal is not guaranteed to be successful, the competitor may choose to keep the timer running while appealing it, and resume the attempt when appropriate.
    - 11e1) [CORRESPONDING] The extra attempt must be scrambled using an unmodified scramble sequence generated by an official scrambler (see Regulation 4f and Guidelines 4f).
11f) [CORRESPONDING] [NOTE: We need the Board to give us a good justification for the video evidence rule.]


## Article A: Speed Solving

A1a3) [CORRESPONDING] The organisation team and the WCA Delegate must be mindful that time limits influence the strategies of the competitors (e.g. rushing the first two solves in hopes of meeting a cutoff in a combined round), and that changing time limits after the beginning of the round can disadvantage some competitors unfairly.
A6b) [CORRESPONDING] The arbitrary value of 0.06 seconds was chosen to accommodate concerns about Stackmat timers.


## Article D: Solving With Feet

D1c) [CORRESPONDING] This rule still applies while repairing puzzle defects.


## Article H: Multiple Blindfolded Solving

H1b1) [CORRESPONDING] The judge may allow the competitor to continue the attempt unofficially, but the attempt must be interrupted and finished first, in full accordance with the Regulations.
