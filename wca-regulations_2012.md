Reports must be available within one week of the competition date. [NOTE: To whom are reports required to be made available? Are they closed to the Board, between the Board and the organisation team, or open to the public/WCA community? This ought to be specified.]
    - 1c3) Sending the competition results to the WCA Results Team. [NOTE: Who/what is the Results Team? This needs to be defined in the document, or else a referred definition ought to be provided.] Results should be ready at the end of the last day of competition.
    - 1c3a) All scrambles used during a competition should be sent with the results of the competition.
    - 1c4) Sending corrections to the competition results to the WCA Board. Corrections should be available within one week of the competition date.

    - 1c8) Providing the scrambles. [NOTE: Is there another article with further clarification? If so, provide the article number.]
    - 1c9) Decisions on changes to the scheduled times of rounds. In cases of such changes, a clear announcement should be made to all competitors.
- 1e) Each event must be assigned one or more judges.
    - 1e1) A judge for an event is responsible for executing the procedures of the event.
    - 1e1a) A judge may judge multiple competitors simultaneously, so long as the judge is able ensure that all Competition Regulations are followed at all times.

    - 1g2) Any changes to the score sheets must made with the consent of the WCA Delegate.
- 1h) Competitors in the same round of an event may be divided into groups. [NOTE: "flight" may be a debate-centric term; you might prefer another, less specific term, such as "shift"]  [NOTE: Is it necessary to spell out the reasons for splitting an event into flights? Does that affect the competition in a regulatory capacity?]
    - 1h1) Judges/scramblers for a round must not judge or scramble for competitors in their own group before they have completed all of their solves for the round. 
    - 1h2) Different groups must use different scramble sequences and same [groups] must use the same scramble sequences.

    - 2a1) complies with WCA regulations;
    - 2a2) meets the competition requirements, which must be clearly announced before the competition;
    - 2a3) is not suspended by WCA Board.

    - 2c1) A competitor shall not be eligible to compete without a completed registration. [NOTE: Please decide the exact person(s) who shall determine the composition of a "complete registration," and use one designation for said person(s) throughout. In the space of two sub-articles, you've used "organisation team," "competition organiser" and "WCA Delegate".]
- 2d) All information (except: name, country, date of birth [NOTE: I find it hard to believe that date of birth is not considered confidential. Most organisations (especially online transactions/registries) will not release DOBs for fear of identity theft/fraud liability], gender, selected events and competition results [NOTE: also, given the breadth of such exceptions, what personal information remains protected?]) must be used for the competition only, and may only be disclosed to outside organisations/persons with the consent of the competitor. A competitor's date of birth is considered confidential information, and must never be shared with other parties without prior consent of the competitor or legal guardian, as applicable.
- 2e) Competitors may only [NOTEL: Rephrease using "must"] represent countries of which they hold citizenship. The WCA Delegate should verify citizenship standing by means of  documents (e.g. a passport). If a competitor is found ineligible to represent the country under which they have registered, the competitor may be retroactively disqualified and/or suspended at the discretion of the WCA Board.
    - 2e1a) The eligible countries are defined by Wikipedia List of sovereign states ("Internationally recognized sovereign states" and "Other states"). [NOTE: Why Wikipedia? You could use the UN list, or something actually recognized by sovereign governments.]
    - 2e2) Competitors with more than one citizenship may change their country of representation in their first competition of a calendar year.
- 2f) Competitors must obey venue regulations and conduct themselves in a manner considerate of others.
- 2g) Competitors must remain quiet when inside the designated competition area. Talking is permitted, but must be kept at a reasonable level, and away from active competitors [NOTEL: Was "those competing". Resolve.].
- 2h) Competitors shall be fully dressed while in the competition venue. At the discretion of the Delegate, competitors may be disqualified for inappropriate clothing.
    - 2h1) Exception: Competitors may be barefoot if 3x3x3 Feet Solving is being held at the competition.
- 2i) While competing, competitors must not use sound  or other electronic equipment (e.g. cell phones, MP3 players, dictaphones, or additional lighting).

- 2o) Disputes are only permitted during the competition, within 30 minutes after the disputed incident happened and before the start of the next round of the event.
- 2p) The WCA Delegate must resolve the dispute before the start of the next round of the event.
- 2q) Disputes are only permitted within the parameters of the discretion of the organisation team. [NOTE: This is extremely vague; I'm not sure what this is supposed to mean. Are there actual parameters (and if so, are they listed anywhere in this document?)? If there are parameters, then how much leeway is afforded "the discretion of the organisation team?"] 
- 2r) The competitor must accept the final ruling of the WCA Delegate. Penalty: disqualification of the competitor from the competition.The final ruling of the WCA Delegate may not be disputed; further dispute may lead to disqualification of the competitor in question. [NOTE: Perhaps you should find some way to replace all instances of "Penalty:" with a full sentence, as demonstrated above.]
    - 2s1) For competitors with hearing disabilities, judges may replace the vocal instructions with hand signals.
    - 2s2) For competitors with physical disabilities, judges may give help with starting and stopping the timer.
    - 2s3) Competitors with other disabilities that may prevent them from abiding by one or more Competition Regulations may request special accommodations with the WCA Delegate. Such accommodations must be noted in the Delegate Report. [NOTE: All sub-articles (e.g. 2s) with sub-points (e.g. 2s1) should have a heading at the sub-article level.]
- 2t) All competitors should be familiar with and understand the WCA regulations before the competition.

## Article 3: Puzzles
- 3a) Competitors must provide their own puzzles for the competition. Competitors may borrow puzzles from other competitors. 
    - 3a1) Competitors must be present and ready to compete when they are called to compete for a round. [NOTEL: revise] Penalty: disqualification from the event. 
- 3b) Puzzles must be in fully operational, such that normal scrambling is possible.
- 3c) Polyhedral puzzles must use a colour scheme with one colour per face in the solved state.  All puzzle variations must have moves, positions and solutions functionally identical to the original puzzle.
- 3d) Puzzles must have coloured stickers, coloured tiles, textures or painted/printed colours. Textured puzzles must have uniform texture patterns throughout. [NOTEL: Sarah had "throughout"]  Competitors with a medically documented visual disability may use textured puzzles with different textures on each face. Textures/patterns must be uniform per face.
    - 3d1) Textured puzzles must have different colours on each face to aid in scrambling and judging.
- 3e) The colours of puzzles must be solid and of uniform shade per face; each colour on the puzzle must be clearly distinct from other colours thereupon.
- 3f) Stickers/tiles/textures/paint must not be thicker than 1.5 mm, or the generally available thickness for non-cube puzzles.
- 3g) Puzzles may be refined internally by sanding or applying any form of lubricant.
- 3h) Modifications that enhance the basic concept of a puzzle are not permitted. Examples of said enhancement include: new moves are possible, normal moves are impossible, more pieces or faces are visible, colours on the backside of the puzzle are visible, moves are done automatically, more or other solved states.
- 3i) "Pillowed" and other modified versions of puzzles are permitted if and only if the modification does not make available to the competitor additional information (e.g. identity of faces) [from any possible angle of the puzzle in any possible configuration NOTE: this is confusing and possibly unnecessary.], as compared to a non-pillowed version of the same puzzle. This is subject to the following exceptions and clarifications:
    - 3i1) Exception to 3i: Pillowed 7x7x7 cubes are permitted.
    - 3i2) "Stickerless" cubes, and other cubes whose face colours are visible inside the cube, are not permitted. [NOTE: I find this language vague, but perhaps most cubers will be familiar with the object in question.]
- 3j) Any modifications to a puzzle that result in poor performance by a competitor are not grounds for additional attempts in the event.
- 3k) Puzzles must be clean, and must not have any markings, elevated pieces, damage, or other differences that distinguish one piece from any likepiece. [NOTE: The term "piece" may be vague.]
- 3l) Puzzles must be approved by  the WCA Delegate before use in the competition.
- 3m) Cube puzzles must have at most one logo. For the Rubik's Cube or bigger cube puzzles the logo must be placed on one of the centre pieces.
    - 3m1) Colourless engravings (max. 1 per colour) are not considered as logos.
- 3n) All brands of puzzle and puzzle parts are allowed, given the puzzles' complance with all WCA regulations.

## Article 4: Scrambling
- 4a) A scrambler must apply the scramble sequences.
- 4b) Puzzles must be scrambled using computer-generated random scramble sequences or scrambled positions known only to the WCA Delegate and the scrambler. [NOTE: The "must" employed at the beginning of the sentence applies to all clauses in said sentence -- no need to write it in twice.] Generated scrambles must not be inspected before the competition, and must not be filtered or selected in any way by the WCA Delegate.
- 4d) Cube puzzles and Megaminx must be scrambled with the lightest-coloured face (usually white) on top and darkest-coloured adjacent face (usually green) in front. Pyraminx must be scrambled with the lightest-coloured face (usually yellow) on bottom and darkest-coloured face (usually green) in front. Square-1 must be scrambled with the darkest-coloured face in front (of the two possible scrambling orientations).
- 4f) Competition scrambles must be generated using the current official version of the WCA scrambling program (available via the WCA website).

## Article 5: Puzzle Defects
- 5a) Examples of puzzle defects include: popped pieces; broken wires; and detached screws,caps, and stickers.
- 5b) If a puzzle defect occurs during the solve, the competitor may choose to repair the defect and continue the solve, or to discontinue the solve.
    - 5b1) If a competitor chooses to repair the puzzle, he must repair only the defective pieces. Tools and/or pieces of other puzzles must not be used to repair the original puzzle. Noncompliant competitors shall be disqualified for the duration of the solve.
    - 5b2) Any repair to a puzzle must not confer upon the competitor any advantage in solving said puzzle. Noncompliant competitors shall be disqualified for the duration of the solve.
    - 5b3) If, after repairing the puzzle but before the end of the solve, the competitor finds that the puzzle is unsolvable, he may disassemble and assemble a maximum of four pieces to render the puzzle solvable.
    - 5b4) In blindfolded events, a puzzle defect may only be repaired during the solve, and all repairs must be performed blindfolded. Noncompliant competitors shall be disqualified for the duration of the solve.
    - 5b5) If, after the solve,  parts of the puzzle(e.g. a centre cap of a cube)  are still defective or not fully rotated (e.g. a 5x5x5 centre piece twisted in its spot), the result shall be recorded as the worst state obtainable via reassembly of the puzzle (e.g. a pyraminx with a detached tip may be reassembled in three states one fully solved, and two "+2" states; said solve would be recorded as a "+2" state). [NOTE: Is the term "+2" the most correct technical definition? If so, perhaps the quotation marks should be removed.]  
- 5c) If a competitor's puzzle presents a defect during a solve, he is not permitted an extra attempt.

## Article 7: Environment
- 7a) Competitions may be held atany location, indoors or outdoors.
- 7b) Spectators must remain at least 1.50 meters away from the competition stage when it is in use..
- 7c) Lighting of the competition area ought be paid special attention, [NOTE: Is this an advisory or a regulation?] White light is preferred. [NOTE: If the latter clause is necessary, perhaps "such that competitors may readily differentiate between the colours on the puzzles."]
- 7e) The competition area must be smoke-free.
- 7f) The timer must be attached to the mat and placed upright on the table, desk or other suitable console , with the device on the near side of the mat. [NOTE: Specify -- near to whom/what? The competitor? The judge? e.g. "the side of the mat nearest the competitor".] The mat must be placed flush against the surface of the table.
    - 7f1) Exception: In Solving With Feet the timer must be placed directly on the floor. The timer device may [NOTE: is this an advisory or a regulation?] be placed on the far side of the mat. [NOTE: again, specify -- is this the far side from the competitor's perspective?]
- 7h) A competitors area must be designated within the competition area.
    - 7h1) Competitors who have been called to compete - and only those competitors - must remain within the competitors area until all solves of the round have been completed. [NOTE: does this mean all of their own solves of the round, or all the solves of all competitors in the round?]
    - 7h3) Competitors in the competitors area must not communicate with each other about the scrambled positions of the puzzles of the round in progress. Noncompliant competitors may be disqualified at the discretion of the Delegate.

## Article 8: Competitions
- 8a) An official WCA competition must:
    - 8a1) be approved by the WCA Board.
    - 8a2) follow WCA regulations.

## Article 9: Events
- 9a) The WCA governs competitions for:
all puzzles known as Rubik puzzles; and
all other puzzles manipulated by twisting the sides, commonly known as 'Twisty puzzles'.

- 9b) The official events and formats of WCA competition consist of:
    - 9b1) Rubik's Cube, 2x2x2 Cube, 4x4x4 Cube, 5x5x5 Cube, Clock, Magic, Master Magic, Megaminx, Pyraminx, Square-1, Rubik's Cube: One-handed and Rubik's Cube: With Feet. 

      Permissible competition formats for these events include: 'Best of x' [NOTE: define 'x' here (e.g. "where 'x' is an integer between three and seven, inclusive")] and 'Average of Five' [NOTE: Choose a consistent style for numbers throughout the document (either use the Arabic numeral or spell out the number in English), excepting cube size designations. I won't take the time to correct them -- that would be kind of pointless -- just choose one and do it yourself.]

    - 9b2) 6x6x6 Cube and 7x7x7 Cube. 

      Permissible competition formats for these events include: 'Best of x' [see NOTE in 8b1] and 'Average of Three' [NOTE: Unless "average" and "mean" have different definitions as used here, you should use the same word in both clauses.]

    - 9b3) Rubik's Cube: Fewest moves, Rubik's Cube: Blindfolded, 4x4x4 Cube: Blindfolded, 5x5x5 Cube: Blindfolded and Rubik's Cube: Multiple Blindfolded. 

      Permissible competition formats for these events include: 'Best of x' [see NOTE in 9b1]

- 9e) New official events may be added, and existing official events removed, each calendar year.
    - 9e1) The decision to add or remove an event is made by the WCA Board, based on feedback from the WCA delegates and the community at large.
    - 9e4) Events other than those specified in article 9b may be held during a competition, but will be considered unofficial and therefore will not be included in the official results of the competition.
- 9f) The results of a round are measured as follows:
    - 9f1) All timed results under 10 minutes and corresponding averages/means are measured in hundredths of a second, with averages/means rounded down to the nearest hundredth of a second (x.009 becomes x.00, x.010 becomes x.01). [NOTE: choose either the term "average" or the term "mean" and use it consistently throughout the document. No need to have both. I'll stop commenting on this henceforth -- just pick one and use it throughout.]
    - 9f2) All timed results over 10 minutes and corresponding averages/means are measured in seconds, with averages/means rounded to the nearest second (x.4 becomes x, x.5 becomes x+1).
    - 9f4) The result of a solve shall be recorded as DNF (Did Not Finish) if said solve is disqualified or unfinished.
    - 9f5) The result of a solve shall be recorded as DNS (Did Not Start) if a competitor declines to attempt said solve during a round.
    - 9f6) For 'Best of x' rounds, competitors are each allotted x (at most 3) attempts. [NOTE: The meaning is vague. Do you mean that x is less than or equal to 3? In that case, write "competitors are allotted x attempts. x may/shall/must not exceed 3."] The best result of x attempts shall be recorded as the competitor's official result for the event. Competitors may be allotted a cumulative time limit for the event, e.g. 30 minutes for 'Best of 2'.
    - 9f7) For 'Best of x' rounds, a DNF or DNS is the worst possible result. If all results are DNF and/or DNS, the best result of the competitor is recorded as DNF. [NOTE: Is the second sentence really necessary?]
    - 9f8) For 'Average of 5' rounds, competitors are allotted 5 attempts. Of these 5 attempts, the best and worst attempts shall be omitted from record, and the competitor's official score shall be recorded as the mean of the remaining 3 attempts.
    - 9f9) For 'Average of 5' rounds, one DNF or DNS is permitted to count as the competitor's worst result of said round. If a competitor scores more than one DNF and/or DNS in said round, his average score for the round is DNF.
    - 9f10) For 'Mean of 3' rounds competitors are allotted 3 attempts. The competitor's official score shall be recorded as of mean of said 3 attempts.
    - 9f11) For 'Mean of 3' rounds, if the competitor scores at least one DNF or DNS, his average score for the round is DNF.
    - 9f12) For 'Best of x' rounds rankings are assessed based on the best result per competitor, where "best" is defined as the shortest recorded time.
    - 9f13) For 'Mean of' and 'Average of' rounds, rankings are assessed based on the best average/mean per competitor, where "best" is defined as the shortest recorded time.
    - 9f14) For 'Mean of' and 'Average of' rounds where two or more competitors achieve identical average/mean results, said competitors' rankings are assessed based on the best result per competitor, where "best" is defined as the shortest recorded time.
    - 9f15) Competitors who achieve the same result in a round receive identical rankings for said round.
    - 9f16) For the [Rubik's Cube: Multiple Blindfolded NOTE: it took me a while to figure out what this meant. In the final document, please bold or italicise the names of the events to minimize confusion.] event, rankings are assessed based on number of puzzles solved minus the number of puzzles not solved, where a greater difference is superior. If the difference is less than 0, the result shall be disqualified. [NOTE: as a rule of thumb, use "shall be" if the sentence uses a conditional clause (i.e. "if"); otherwise, use "is/are."] If competitors achieve the same result, rankings shall be assessed based on total time, where the shorter recorded time is superior. If competitors achieve the same result and the same time, rankings shall be assessed based on the number of puzzles said competitors fail to solve, where fewer unsolved puzzles are superior. [NOTE: perhaps this paragraph ought to be split into multiple clauses. It's a bit dense, especially for the layperson.]
- 9g) A Combined Round consists of two phases of solves, where competitors advance to the second phase only if they score below a designated time limit during the first phase. [NOTE: this definition needs serious reworking. I still don't think I could define it if you asked me.]
    - 9g2) Whether a competitor proceeds to next phase of a Combined round, must be decided on position (best x competitors) or on result (all competitors with a best result under x). [NOTE: I have no idea what this means. Doesn't this directly contradict the clause above it?]
- 9i) Results of official WCA competitions (where full WCA regulations are in effect) must be applied to the WCA world rankings. [NOTE: this (9i and its sub-clauses) seems extremely out of place. Isn't there some other article in this document that discusses the website?]
    - 9i1) Regional records, where applicable, are recognised as national/continental/world records.
    - 9i2) Results of official WCA competitions are dated to the calendar date of the competition. Should a competition span multiple days, the results of each round are dated to the last scheduled calendar date of the round.
    - 9i3) Should the regulations for an event be changed, existing regional records stand until they are broken under the new regulations. [NOTE: Why regional records specifically (as opposed to, say, national/world/etc.)?]
- 9j) Each events must be held only once per competition.
- 9k) All competitors may participate in all events of a competition.
- 9l) Each round must be finished before the next round of the event starts. 
- 9m) Events must have at most four rounds.
    - 9m1) Events with 99 or fewer competitors must have at most three rounds.
    - 9m2) Events with 15 or fewer competitors must have at most two rounds.
    - 9m3) Events with 7 or fewer competitors must have at most one round.
- 9o) A Combined round and a Qualification round count as one round when counting the number of rounds per event.
- 9p) Elimination rounds
    - 9p1) At least 25% of competitors must be eliminated per round.
    - 9p2) The competitors who advance to the next elimination round shall be determined by either a cutoff rank or a cutoff time in the preceeding elimination round, the latter to be specified before the preceeding elimination round begins.
    - 9p3) Should a qualifying competitor withdraw from an elimination round, he may be replaced by the highest-scoring competitor below the cutoff from the preceeding round. [NOTE: there's inconsistent usage of "score" vs. "time" -- you ought to clear that up]
- 9r) A qualification round is held, where necessary, before the first elimination round of an event. [NOTE: this (important!) definition needs to appear before 9g.]
    - 9r1) When announcing an event, the organisation team must include:
        - the number of competitors competing in the first round of the event
        - the maximum number of competitors permitted in the qualification round of the event, and the number of said competitors who will proceed to the first round
        - the average/mean time or single solve time, achieved in previous competition, required to qualify directly for the first round of the event
        - the date used to determine the average/mean time or single solve time on the WCA ranking of each competitor [NOTE: still confused about this. You fix it.]
    - 9r2) All competitors of an event who have not directly qualified for the first round of the event must compete in the qualification round in order to participate in the elimination round(s).
    - 9r3) The maximum number of competitors in the qualification round or first round of an event may be increased. Additional qualification rounds may be added to accommodate newly registered competitors. These changes must be made at least two weeks before the competition.
- 9s) Each round of each event must have a time limit. If a competitor does not solve within the time limit, the judge may terminate and disqualify the solve. The The competitor continues the round at the discretion of the WCA delegate.

## Article 10: Solved state
- 10b) Only the resting state of the puzzle, after the timer has stopped, is considered.
- 10c) Puzzles may be in any orientation at the end of the solve.
- 10d) All pieces of a puzzle must be fully attached to said puzzle and in their required positions. Exceptions: see Article 5 Puzzle defects.
- 10e) A puzzle is solved when all face colours are reconstructed and all parts are aligned within the limits specified below:
    - 10e1) For each two adjacent parts (e.g. two parallel adjacent slices of a cube) of the puzzle that are misaligned more than the limit described in Article 10f, the puzzle shall be considered to be one move from its solved state (Half Turn Metric). [NOTE: what is a Half Turn Metric? Is this described elsewhere in the document? If not, define it here. As a general rule, all specialised terminology should be defined at the point in the document that where it first appears, even if said definition is merely a reference to another part of the document.]
    - 10e2) If no further moves are required to bring the puzzle to its solved state, the puzzle shall be considered solved without penalty.
    - 10e3) If one move is required, the puzzle shall be considered solved with a penalty of 2 seconds.
    - 10e4) If more than one move is required, the solve is ruled DNF.
- 10f) Limits of acceptable misalignment for puzzles:
    - cube-shaped puzzles: =< 45 degrees
    - Megaminx: =< 36 degrees
    - Pyraminx: =< 60 degrees
    - Square-1: =< 45 degrees (U/D) or 90 degrees (/)

Examples:

Solved = no penalty
Misalignment <= 45Â° Solved, with penalty
Only 2 adjacent parts misaligned > 45Â° Not solved
2 misalignments > 45Â°

Solved, with penalty
1 misalignment > 45Â° Solved = no penalty
All misalignments <= 45Â° Solved = no penalty
Misalignment <= 45Â°

Not solved
2 misalignments > 45Â° Solved = no penalty
All misalignments <= 45Â° Solved, with penalty
1 misalignment > 45Â°

- 10g) For Magic (and similar puzzles) the minimum acceptable angle between adjacent tiles is 135Â°.
    - 10g1) If at most two pairs of adjacent tiles are at a smaller angle, and the puzzle is otherwise solved, the puzzle shall be considered solved with a penalty of 2 seconds. For all other cases, the result shall be recorded as DNF.
- 10h) Puzzles not specified in this article shall be adjudicated according to the solved state as defined by the generally accepted goal of the puzzle, applying where relevant the regulations of the Rubik's cube's solved state.

## Article 11: Incidents
- 11a) Incidents include:
    - 11a1) Incorrect execution of event procedures, by officials or competitors.
    - 11a2) Interference or facility malfunctions (such as power failure, emergency alarm activation, etc.).
    - 11a3) Equipment malfunction.
- 11b) Should an incident occur during an event, the WCA Delegate must determine an impartial and appropriate course of action, drawing from WCA regulations where possible. [NOTE: I merged 11d into 11b (there was no 11c).]
- 11e) Should an incident occur during an event, the WCA Delegate may award a competitor another attempt, replacing the attempt during which the incident occurred. The competitor must appeal at the time of the incident, before completing the solve, to be eligible for another attempt. An appeal does not guarantee the competitor an extra attempt.
- 11f) The WCA Delegate must not support his decisions with video or photographic analysis. A competitor may, however, submit video or photographic evidence supporting an appeal to the WCA Board.

## Article A: Speed Solving 
- A1) Attempts for events categorised under Speed Solving must abide by the following procedure.
    - A1a) The time limit per solve is 10 minutes, subject to change by the organisation team (which must be announced before the event). If announced before the event, cumulative time limits may be enforced (e.g. 3 attempts with a cumulative time limit of 20 minutes). The time elapsed in a solve declared a "DNF" counts towards the cumulative time limit. Time limits must not be changed after an event has begun. [NOTE: consider dividing this into multiple clauses.]
    - A1b) For time limits greater than 10 minutes, a stopwatch must be used, in addition to a Stackmat, for timekeeping. If the puzzle is solved within 10 minutes, the Stackmat time is the result; otherwise the stopwatch time is the result.
    - A1c) A competitor participating in an event must be able to fulfil said event's requirements. Competitors competing with expectation of DNF may be disqualified from the event at the discretion of the Delegate.
- A2) Scrambling
    - A2a) At the beginning of the event, the competitor submits his puzzle, in its solved state, to the scrambler and waits in the competitors area until he is called to compete.
    - A2b) A scrambler scrambles the puzzle according to the regulations in Article 4.
    - A2c) After the scrambler starts the scramble, the competitor must not see the puzzle until the the inspection phase begins.
    - A2d) When taking a puzzle from the scrambler, the judge shall briefly inspect the puzzle to ensure thorough scrambling of said puzzle. The judge shall raise any concerns with the scrambler, who shall then conduct a detailed check.
    - A2e) The judge shall place the puzzle onto the mat in a random orientation and shall cover it completely. The competitor must not request a specific orientation. Penalty: 2 seconds. [NOTE: is the last sentence (and the penalty clause) necessary?]
- A3) Inspection
    - A3a) The competitor may inspect the puzzle before beginning each solve.
    - A3a1) The competitor is allotted a maximum of 15 seconds to inspect the puzzle and start the solve.
    - A3b) The judge shall then reset the timer and, where applicable, the stopwatch.
    - A3b1) When the judge and the competitor mutually agree, within one minute [NOTE: I'm confused about the meaning of "within one minute".], that the competitor is ready to begin his inspection, the judge asks the competitor, 'READY?'.
    - A3b2) When the competitor confirms his readiness, the judge uncovers the puzzle and simultaneous starts the stopwatch.
    - A3c) The competitor may pick up the puzzle during inspection.
    - A3c1) The competitor must not apply moves during inspection. Penalty: disqualification of the solve.
    - A3c2) If the pieces of the puzzle are not fully aligned, then the competitor may align the faces (said alignment, on cubes, must not exceed 45 degrees) [NOTE: is the parenthetical necessary?].
    - A3c3) The competitor may reset the timer before he starts the solve.
    - A3d) At the end of the inspection, the competitor must place the puzzle on the mat, in any the orientation and position.
    - A3d1) The puzzle must rest on the mat rather than the timer unit of the Stackmat. Penalty : 2 seconds.
    - A3d2) When 8 seconds of inspection have elapsed, the judge calls '8 seconds'.
    - A3d3) When 12 seconds of inspection have elapsed, the judge calls 'GO', whereupon the competitor begins the solve.
- A4) Starting the solve
    - A4b) The competitor must place his hands on the elevated sensor unit of the Stackmat, with his fingers touching the sensors and palms down. Penalty: 2 seconds.
    - A4b1) The competitor must have no physical contact with the puzzle between the inspection period and the start of the solve. Penalty: 2 seconds.
    - A4d) The competitor starts the solve by confirming that the timer light is green and then removing his hands from the timer, thereby starting the timer.
    - A4d1) Should the competitor fail to start the solve within 15 seconds of the start of the inspection period, he shall incur a penalty of 2 seconds on the solve.
    - A4d2) Should the competitor fail to start the solve within 17 seconds of the start of the inspection, the solve shall be disqualified.
    - A4e) Time penalties for Starting the Solve are not cumulative. There is a maximum of 1 time penalty for Starting the Solve. [NOTE: given the way I changed the sentence structure of A4d1 and A4d2, this clause no longer seems necessary.]
- A5) During the solve
    - A5a) While inspecting or solving the puzzle, the competitor must not communicate with anyone other than the judge. Penalty: disqualification of the solve.
    - A5b) While inspecting or solving the puzzle, the competitor must not receive assistance from anyone or any object other than the surface on which the timer is located. Penalty: disqualification of the solve.
- A6) Ending the solve
    - A6a) The competitor ends the solve by releasing the puzzle and then stopping the timer. If a stopwatch is in use as the timing device, the competitor ends the solve by releasing the puzzle and notifying the judge that he has finished. The competitor's default signal consists of the release any puzzle(s) in hand and the placing of his hands on the surface, with palms down. The competitor and the judge may also agree upon another appropriate notification before the start of the solve. [NOTE: "start" and "beginning" basically mean the same thing. Just stick to one consistently.]
    - A6b) The competitor is responsible for correctly stopping the timer.
    - A6b1) If the timer stops before the end of the solve and the timer shows a time strictly below 0.06 seconds, then the solve shall be replaced by an additional solve. A competitor forfeits his right to said additional solve if the WCA Delegate determines that the timer was stopped deliberately.
    - A6b2) If the timer stops before the end of the solve and the timer displays a time of 0.06 seconds or higher then the solve shall be disqualified, unless the competitor can demonstrate to the WCA delegate's satisfaction that the timer malfunctioned during the solve.
    - A6c) The timer must be stopped using both hands, which shall be placed flat on the sensor and with palms down. Penalty: 2 seconds.
    - A6d) The competitor must fully release the puzzle before stopping the timer. Penalty: 2 seconds.
    - A6e) The competitor must not touch or move the puzzle until the judge has inspected said puzzle. Penalty: disqualification of the solve.
    - A6f) The competitor must not reset the timer until the judge has recorded the result on the competition sheet. [NOTE: I'm sure there's a term better than "competition sheet." Do you guys actually call it that?] Penalty: disqualification of the solve (courtesy of judge). [NOTE: what does "courtesy of judge" mean? Is it the same as "at the discretion of the judge"?]
    - A6g) The judge must not make moves or align faces when inspecting the puzzle. The judge must determine whether the puzzle has been completely solved.
    - A6h) Should a dispute occur, no moves or alignments may be applied to the puzzle prior to the resolution of said dispute. [involving the WCA Delegate if needed NOTE: shouldn't this be in the disputes arbitration section rather than here?] Penalty: disqualification of the solve (courtesy of judge). [see NOTE in A6f]
    - A6i) Time penalties for Ending the Solve are not cumulative; a maximum of 1 time penalty for Ending the Solve may be applied.
- A7) Administration [NOTE: this article title is misleading (one might assume you're talking about the administration of the WCA organisationn).]
    - A7a) If the judge finds a solve correct, the judge shall call 'OK'.
    - A7b) The judge shall record the result of the approved solve on a competition sheet, and signs the sheet (name and signature are both acceptable).
    - A7b1) Where penalties are applied, the judge shall record the result displayed on the timer, and record the penalty adjacent, in the format "X + T + Y = F", where X represents a sum total of penalties incurred before a solve, T represents the time displayed on the timer, Y represents a sum total of penalties incurred during/after a solve, and F represents the final result. If the value of X and/or Y is zero, said term is omitted (e.g. 2 + 17.65 + 2 = 21.65, or 17.65 + 2 = 19.65).
    - A7c) The competitor is responsible for confirming the recorded result, immediately after the judge records it.
    - A7d) If the judge assigns a penalty, the judge shall call 'PENALTY'. The competitor must sign the score sheet to acknowledge the penalty. [NOTE: does the competitor always sign the score sheet, or only in the case of a penalty/DNF?]
    - A7e) If the result is DNF, then judge calls 'NO FINISH'. The competitor must sign the score sheet to acknowledge the result.
    - A7f) At the end of a competitor's round the judge shall deliver the competition sheet to the score taker. [NOTE: is the competition sheet the same thing as the score sheet? Use one consistent term if so.]

## Article B: Blindfolded Solving
- B1) Standard procedure shall be followed pursuant to Article A (Speed Solving). Additional regulations specific to Blindfolded Solving, which supersede Article A where conflicts arise therewith, are described below:
    - B1a) The competitor is not permitted an inspection period.
    - B1b1) The competitor must supply his own blindfold.
    - B1c) The competitor must not come in contact with the interior components of the puzzle. Penalty: disqualification of the solve.
    - B1d) The competitor must use a tiled, stickered, or painted puzzle without distinguishing textures or markings. [NOTE: what do you mean by "markings"? Aren't markings generally visual?]
- B2) Starting the solve
    - B2a) The judge shall reset the timer and stopwatch.
    - B2b) The competitor must place his hands on the elevated sensor unit of the Stackmat, with his fingers touching the sensors and palms down. Penalty: 2 seconds.
    - B2c) The competitor must have no physical contact with the puzzle before the start of the solve. Penalty: 2 seconds.
    - B2d) The competitor starts the solve by removing his hands from the timer, thereby starting the timer.
    - B2d1) The competitor must remove the cover from the puzzle after starting the timer.
    - B2e) If a stopwatch, in addition to a Stackmat, is in use, the judge shall start the stopwatch as soon as the competitor starts the solve.
- B3) Memorisation
    - B3a) The competitor may pick up the puzzle during the memorisation phase and the solve.
    - B3b) The competitor must not make physical notes. Penalty: disqualification of the solve.

    - B4a) The competitor shall don the blindfold after the memorisation phase.
    - B4b) The competitor must not apply moves to the puzzle before he has fully donned the blindfold.
    - B4c) The judge must hold a sheet of paper or a like object between the competitor's face and the puzzle for the duration of the solve, without limiting physical movement of the competitor, unless the position of the puzzle is such that it is demonstrably impossible for the competitor to see the puzzle in any manner. [NOTE: there's got to be a better word for "position" in the above sentence -- but the only one I can come up with right now is "location," which is equally problematic. Think about it some more.]
    - B4d) The competitor must not look at the puzzle at any point during the solve. Penalty: disqualification of the solve.
    - B4e) The competitor may remove and don the blindfold at will prior to applying the first move to the puzzle.
- B5) Ending the solve
    - B5a) When using the Stackmat, the competitor ends the solve by releasing the puzzle and then stopping the timer.
    - B5b) When using a stopwatch, the competitor ends the solve by placing the puzzle back onto the surface and notifying the judge that the solve has ended, whereupon the judge stops the timer.
    - B5c) The competitor may remove the blindfold before he stops the timer; he must apply no further moves to the puzzle after the blindfold is removed. Penalty: disqualification of the solve.

## Article C: One-handed Solving
- C1) Standard procedure shall be followed pursuant to Article A (Speed Solving). Additional regulations specific to One-handed Solving, which supersede Article A where conflicts arise therewith, are described below:
    - C1a) During the solve the competitor must use only one hand and the surface. Penalty: disqualification of the solve.
    - C1b) During the solve no other body part, nor any object other than the surface, shall touch the puzzle. Penalty: disqualification of the solve.
    - C1b2) If a puzzle defect occurs, and the competitor chooses to repair it, all repairs must be made with said hand, and, if necessary, the surface. Penalty: disqualification of the solve.
    - C1c) During the solve, once a competitor touches the puzzle with one hand, he must not touch the puzzle with the other hand. Penalty: disqualification of the solve.

## Article D: Solving With Feet
- D1) Standard procedure shall followed pursuant to Article A (Speed Solving). Additional regulations specific to Solving With Feet, which supersede Article A where conflicts arise therewith, are described below:
    - D1a) The competitor must sit in a chair, sit on the surface, or stand during the solve. [NOTE: I find the grammar of "sit on the surface" problematic. The problematic part is probably "surface." Keep thinking.]
    - D1b) During the inspection and the solve, the competitor must only use his feet (socks optional) and the surface. Penalty: disqualification of the solve.
    - D1c) Other body parts or other objects must not touch the puzzle. Penalty: disqualification of the solve.

- D4) Ending the solve
    - D4a) Competitor must stop the timer by placing his feet onto the timer sensors.

## Article E: Fewest Moves Solving [NOTE: the event name is grammatically irksome. But presumably it has become a recognized term in the community, so I imagine I can't change it.]
- E1) Standard procedure shall followed pursuant to Article A (Speed Solving). Additional regulations specific to Fewest Moves Solving, which supersede Article A where conflicts arise therewith, are described below:
    - E1a) The competitor is permitted a maximum solution length of 80 (moves and rotations). [NOTE: is there a difference between moves and rotations? was this ever specified?]
- E2) Procedure for Fewest Moves Solving:
    - E2a) The judge distributes a prearranged scramble sequence to all competitors with a print of the scramble position. [NOTE: This is really confusing. What's "a print of the scramble position"? Is it an image?] The judge then starts the stopwatch and says 'Go'.
    - E2b) The competitor is allotted a total of 60 minutes to devise a solution consisting of the fewest moves possible.
    - E2b1) A judge should announce the remaining time after 30 minutes, 50 minutes, 55 minutes, and 59 minutes have elapsed, and call 'Stop' at 60 minutes.
    - E2c) At the end of the 60 minutes the competitor must present to the judge clearly and legibly written solution, with notation pursuant to Article 12. Penalty: disqualification of the solve.
    - E2d) The length of the solution shall be calculated in accordance with the Half Turn Metric. [NOTE: Is the Half Turn Metric defined anywhere? If not, especially since this is the first mention, it should be defined here.]
    - E2e) The solution of the competitor must not be influenced in any way by the scrambling algorithm. If called upon, the competitor must be able to reasonably explain the purpose of each move in his solution irrespective of scrambling algorithm. The validity of the solve shall be determined by the WCA delegate. Penalty: disqualification of the solve.
    - E2f) The competitor must be able to give a clear explanation of the solution. [NOTE: E2e and E2f are essentially identical in meaning; the latter is merely more broad. Should these be folded into one clause, or perhaps a clause and sub-clause?]
- E3) The competitor may use the following objects during the solve: paper and pen (both supplied by judge), 3 cubes (self-supplied), unlimited coloured stickers (self-supplied). Penalty for using unauthorized objects: disqualification of the solve.

## Article F: Clock Solving 
- F1) Standard procedure shall be followed pursuant to Article A (Speed Solving). Additional regulations specific to Clock Solving, which supersede Article A where conflicts arise therewith, are described below:
- F2) After scrambling the puzzle, the judge shall place said puzzle onto the Stackmat in a standing position.
- F3) At the conclusion of the inspection period, the competitor shall place the puzzle onto the Stackmat in a standing position. If the positions of any pins have been in any way changed from their scrambled positions, a +2 penalty shall be applied. 
[NOTE: it seems like you're missing a few sub-articles under Article F.]


## Article G: Magic Solving {The following regulations also apply to differently named, like puzzles.)
- G1) Standard procedure shall be followed pursuant to Article A (Speed Solving). Additional regulations specific to Magic Solving, which supersede Article A where conflicts arise therewith, are described below:
    - G1a) All solves on the competition timer will be recorded as official solves.  A competitor may not perform practice solves on the competition timer. [NOTE: is this relevant specifically to Magic Solving? It seems broadly applicable to any kind of puzzle. (e.g. "No fooling around with the timers if you're not officially competing in this event.")]
- G2) The puzzle is not scrambled. [NOTE: ok, I'm really confused. If it's not scrambled, how does the competitor solve it?]
    - G2b) The puzzle is not covered by judge. [NOTE: why is this necessary? Except for blindfolded, none of the puzzles are covered.]
- G3) The competitor is not allotted inspection time.
- G4) At the start of the solve, the puzzle must lie completely flat on the surface. Either of its two sides may face up.

## Article H: Multiple Blindfolded Solving
- H1) Standard procedure shall be followed pursuant to Article B (Blindfolded Solving). Additional regulations specific to Multiple Blindfolded Solving, which supersede Article B where conflicts arise therewith, are described below:
    - H1a) The competitor must submit to the judge [NOTE: I just assumed it was the judge. Specify the person the competitor should talk to prior to the event.], before the start of the event, the number of puzzles (at least 2) he wishes to solve blindfolded per attempt.
    - H1a1) A competitor must not change said number after the start of the event.
    - H1a2) A competitor's requested number of puzzles must not be disclosed until the start of the event.
    - H1b) A competitor is allotted 10 minutes to memorise and solve each cube, up to a maximum of 60 minutes, which shall be measured with a stopwatch to the nearest second.
    - H1b1) Once the allotted time limit is reached, the competitor's attempt shall cease. The numbers of solved and unsolved puzzles are counted.
    - H1d) Penalties for each puzzle of the attempt are additive (e.g. if a competitor attempts 10 cubes, finishes with a time of 59:57, and is penalized two times, the final recorded time is 59:57 + 2*2 = 60:01.).

## Article Z: Optional Regulations
Optional regulations may be applied to a competition by its organisation team to facilitate the administration of said competition.
The WCA Board must approve the application of (an) optional regulation(s) to a competition.

- Z1) The organisation team may collect all puzzles for scrambling during registration.
- Z2) The organisation team may limit the number of events per competitor.
- Z3) The organisation team may select competitors who directly qualify for certain rounds of certain events, based on the results of specific previous competitions.
- Z4) The organisation team may limit the number of competitors per event, on either a "first come first serve" basis, or based upon qualification times or competitors' positions in the current WCA world rankings.
- Z5) The organisation team may prohibit competitors from participating in select combinations of events.
